    outline: "Arthritis of the hip continues to be a leading cause of chronic pain for patients across the UK and current therapy for advanced cases comprises hip replacement. Although technology has improved over the years in terms of the design of hip prostheses, there continue to be major issues associated with the health and overall outlook for patients receiving artificial hips. There is now very strong evidence supporting a link between metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacements (where metals such as cobalt and chromium are used in the artificial joint bearings) and development of heart disease. Over time, cobalt levels rise in the bloodstream of patients with MoM hip replacements and the metal accumulates in various organs of the body. Levels accumulating in the heart can be particularly high. Previous work by our group using rats has shown that cobalt can cause impaired contractile activity of rat hearts. The cellular mechanisms underlying this cobalt-mediated contractile dysfunction may manifest at the level of both contractile and non-contractile cells of the heart. Our work to date has focused on a rat model and we have not explored the effects of cobalt in human cardiac cells. Cardiac fibroblasts are non-contractile cells responsible for providing structural support to the heart via the extracellular matrix and they interact closely with the contractile cardiac myocytes.",
    aim: "This project will investigate whether cobalt may exert detrimental effects on human cardiac fibroblasts and will explore both phenotypic and functional changes at the cellular level.",

    title: "Repurposing combinations of drugs for cancer therapy",
    type: "Experimental Research Projects (Laboratory)",
    students: 3,
    chosenBy: 75,
    subjects: ["Biochemistry", "Biomedical Science", "Pharmacology"],
    outline: "While we are doing well in the treatment of some cancers, there are still many cancers where survival rates are poor. This is in part due to the heterogeneity of cancers and underlying therapy resistance. Despite the considerable resources being invested into the discovery of new cancer drugs, novel therapies suffer from high failure rates, high cost, limited efficacy and a lengthy timeline before they become clinically available. None of this is good for the cancer patient. One approach to circumvent this problem is to repurpose existing non-cancer or cancer drugs against cancers to provide new or novel therapies or to consider new mays of formulating and delivering existing drugs, which could reduce costs, enhance tumour specificity, reduce toxicity or rapidly accelerate the introduction of new therapies into clinical practice. This is particularly relevant for paediatric and hard to treat cancers such as pancreatic cancer, brain tumours, lung cancer and triple negative breast cancer and cancers where there is currently an unmet need for effective less toxic cancer drugs.",
    aim: "The aim of this Project will be to undertake a variety of experiments to assess new therapies for cancer",

New therapies are therefore needed for the treatment of hard to treat and therapy resistant cancer.",
