        outline: "Arthritis of the hip continues to be a leading cause of chronic pain for patients across the UK and current therapy for advanced cases comprises hip replacement. Although technology has improved over the years in terms of the design of hip prostheses, there continue to be major issues associated with the health and overall outlook for patients receiving artificial hips. There is now very strong evidence supporting a link between metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacements (where metals such as cobalt and chromium are used in the artificial joint bearings) and development of heart disease. Over time, cobalt levels rise in the bloodstream of patients with MoM hip replacements and the metal accumulates in various organs of the body. Levels accumulating in the heart can be particularly high. Previous work by our group using rats has shown that cobalt can cause impaired contractile activity of rat hearts. The cellular mechanisms underlying this cobalt-mediated contractile dysfunction may manifest at the level of both contractile and non-contractile cells of the heart. Our work to date has focused on a rat model and we have not explored the effects of cobalt in human cardiac cells.  Cardiac fibroblasts are non-contractile cells responsible for providing structural support to the heart via the extracellular matrix and they interact closely with the contractile cardiac myocytes.",

        outline: "The transport of ammonium across cell membranes is a fundamental biological process that underpins nitrogen metabolism in all kingdoms of life. Ammonium exchange is mediated by the ubiquitous ammonium transporter/methylammonium permease/Rhesus (Amt/Mep/Rh) protein family. The major role of bacterial, fungal, and plant Amt/Mep proteins is to scavenge ammonium for biosynthetic assimilation, whereas mammals are thought to express Rh proteins to detoxify erythrocytes, kidney, and liver cells. Members of the Amt/Mep/Rh family have also been found to be important drivers of the virulence of infectious fungi. In humans, Rh mutations are linked to pathologies that include inherited hemolytic anemia, stomatocytosis, and early-onset depressive disorder. Despite this key general and biomedical importance, so far, no consensus on the pathway and mechanism of ammonium transport by the Amt/Mep/Rh family has been reached. High resolution structures are available for several Amt and Rh proteins. However, the high expectations to elucidate the transport mechanisms from these 3D structures have not been met to date, as all of the structures show the same inward-facing state of the protein. All Amt/Mep/Rh structure shows a strongly hydrophobic pore leading toward the cytoplasm. The pore’s pronounced hydrophobicity had led to the conclusion that the conducted species in the Amt/Mep/Rh family is neutral NH3. However, it has been shown that the transport cycle of two Amt proteins from Archaeoglobus fulgidus were associated with charge translocation. Moreover, our recent in-vitro studies using Solid Supported membrane Electrophysiology reveal that charged species are transferred across the membrane during the transport cycle of the Escherichia coli AmtB, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mep2 and Nitrosomonas europaea Rh proteins (unpublished results). Taken together, these findings renewed the controversies on the Amt/Mep/Rh transport mechanism",

Therefore, the search for new and better drug therapies for treating depression is a continuing global challenge.

These have been based on both traditional (SSRI, SNRI) and novel (5HT1A agonist) pharmacological mechanisms of action. Four different antidepressants, currently marketed in either the UK and/or North America have been selected for investigation in this project (levomilnacipran, vortioxetine, vilazodone and desvenlafaxine). Students will be allocated one of the compound and they will research published research data that investigates the compound’s pharmacological profile, and its pre-clinical and clinical effectiveness as an antidepressant.

        outline: "Exposure of mammalian cell systems to bacteria results initially in the gross activation of macrophages leading to progressive haemodynamic instability and shock that are characteristic of the onset of sepsis, ultimately leading to death.  Following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the active component of bacterial endotoxin, a number of genes are induced, mediated in part through the activation of Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4).  TLR4 engagement leads to the activation of a number of signalling pathways including the critical Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling pathways, namely the canonical and non-canonical pathways regulated by the IKKs, IKKbeta and IKKalpha respectively.  Multiple genes are induced to generate a coordinated transcriptional response. One gene of critical importance in the onset of septicemia and septic shock is that of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and can serve as a marker of the inflammatory response. The induction of iNOS is regulated by NF-kappaB signalling however it remains to be detailed clearly the contribution(s) of the canonical versus the non-canonical pathways in this process. In this project novel IKKalpha- and commercially available IKK-beta selective small molecule kinase inhibitors will be examined for potential anti-inflammatory action against LPS-activated signalling events principally by assessment of changes in agonist-stimulated iNOS expression and activity in a murine macrophage cell model.",

HPV is thought to be the cause of over 90% of cervical cancer cases and in the UK 1,000 women under the age of 35 die from cervical cancer every year. A recent report from Scotland found that routine vaccination of schoolgirls in Scotland had led to a 90% reduction in pre-cancerous cells in smear tests among women aged 20 therefore in the long term cervical cancer could be almost eliminated. The HPV virus has also been linked to a variety of other cancer types including anal cancer, cancer of the penis, vulval cancer, vaginal cancer and some types of head and neck cancer. In a recent study it was found that 78% of people with head and neck cancer in Scotland were men and HPV was found in 60% of cases. Furthermore, oral cancers are the fastest increasing cancer in Scotland, especially in men and HPV infection is thought to be the cause of this. Based on this evidence a routine HPV vaccination program for adolescent boys was introduced by the NHS in 2019. The uptake of the HPV vaccine amongst girls in Scotland is around 80%. To maintain and encourage high uptake of the HPV vaccine and to achieve similar uptake rates amongst schoolboys it is important to spread awareness and understanding of HPV and the link with a number of different cancer types and thus the importance of HPV vaccination.",

These molecules colour our world and are essential in all living organisms; featured members are the green chlorophyll, the red haem, and the red-orange vitamin B12. Iron-containing haem is the most versatile due to the importance of iron redox chemistry in a range of important biological processes. Specialised enzymes degrade haem to recycle iron, producing a variety of haem ‘skeletons’. These haem skeletons are well characterised in animals; they are responsible for the colour of urine and eggshells but are also involved in protection from oxidative damage, in cell regulation, and disease. Recently, pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus[2], Mycobacterium tuberculosis[3], and Escherichia coli[4], have been found to possess non-canonical haem-degrading enzymes that produce unusual haem skeletons that either have biological functions or are metabolic wastes[5]. The project will investigate the different protein families of bacterial haem degrading enzymes, hypothesise about the biological functions, discuss and propose the future directions.",

In humans, approximately 70% of iron is in the form of haem within haemoglobin, which is found in the blood and is responsible for oxygen transport and the red colour[2]. Both humans and bacteria have haem-degrading enzymes that break open haem to release the iron, converting the red/brown pigment into the green-pigmented skeletal product called biliverdin. In humans, biliverdin is further metabolised into yellow and brown pigments, a biochemical process observable in the colour of human bile, bruises, and waste (urine and faecal matter)[3]. How do bacterial pathogens process haem? Using biochemical and chemical methodologies, the project will investigate the enzymatic reactions of a selection of pathogenic bacterial haem-degrading enzymes and their pigment products. The focus will be on mycobacteria, a family of bacteria that includes the notorious M. tuberculosis (M. tb), M. leprae, and the environmental species causing the emerging non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections worldwide. For example, M. tb haem-degrading enzyme is unusual among bacteria because it degrades haem into a purple-pigmented product called mycobilin instead of the green-pigmented biliverdin[4]. The pathophysiological implications of the differences in bacterial haem skeleton pigment are not yet clear[5].",

        outline: "Recent discoveries have elucidated the consensus sequence recognized by ZAP, a protein that targets and degrades viral RNA rich in CpG dinucleotides. Using this knowledge, the project will involve bioinformatic analysis of alphavirus/flavivirus genomes to identify existing ZAP responsive elements (ZREs) and strategically introduce additional CpG sites without disrupting viral protein translation and finally assess the conservation of these ZRE regions. The introduction of these sequences aims to ensure that the virus is rapidly degraded in mammalian cells linked to increased ZAP binding, while still maintaining its viability in mosquito hosts. This project features viruses the Odon lab is interested in testing in the dual mammalian and mosquitoes systems. flaviviruses: Dengue virus, Yellow Fever virus, Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus alphaviruses: Chikungunya, Sindbis virus, Mayaro and West Nile Virus",

Although novel immunotherapies can delay disease progression by 6 months, their efficacy is limited to only mild forms of the disease. Thus, different therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. Amyloid pathology has long been recognized as a hallmark of AD. Various mouse models have been developed to mimic amyloid pathology. However, traditional models, such as APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice, rely on artificial overexpression of mutated genes related to amyloid genesis. To overcome this fundamental limitation in traditional models, knock-in models have been developed. The APPNL-G-F mouse line has recently gained popularity. However, this mouse model remains incompletely characterised when and where amyloid pathology and inflammation occur in the brain. In this project, we will comprehensively characterize amyloid pathology and associated glial (either microglia or astrocytes) responses across the brain. By performing fluorescent immunostaining, we will determine when and where pathology appears in APPNL-G-F mice. The outcome of this project informs future studies to develop a novel intervention strategy.",

        outline: "Sleep is a fundamental homeostatic process in the animal kingdom. In humans, sleep abnormalities are associated with various brain disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism, depression and schizophrenia. Thus, a better understanding of sleep regulatory mechanisms is extremely important for our health. Over the past half-century, neuroscientists uncovered that sleep is controlled by the collective action of neurons, called neural ensembles, across the brain. However, it remains unclear exactly how such neural ensembles are coordinated in distributed neural circuits of the brain. To address this fundamental challenge, it is essential to monitor neural ensembles across the brain at the single-cell level in real-time in vivo. Recently, a consortium of world-leading researchers has developed novel technology, called “Neuropixels”. Like the technology of Elon Musk’s Neuralink, this Neuropixels consists of a needle-like probe containing hundreds of microscale electrodes. This allows to monitor neuronal activity at the single-cell level across multiple brain regions simultaneously. In this lab-based project, we will adopt this cutting-edge technology to investigate how sleep is regulated by distributed neural ensembles in mice. An objective is as follows: sleep is traditionally classified into two major stages, called rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep. However, this classification is based on coarse measurements of electroencephalograms (EEGs) and electromyograms (EMGs). Given the resolution of Neuropixels technology, we will be able to characterize distributed neural ensembles across sleep-wake cycles in unprecedented precision. Since individual neural activity is highly diverse, we will test the hypothesis that sleep can be classified into multiple sub-states beyond the traditional sleep-stage classification. This will provide insight into the development of a novel diagnostic strategy for sleep disorders and mental disorders. In this project, a student will have an opportunity to learn this state-of-the-art technology in the lab. The student will observe experimental procedures and process high-throughput data for a dissertation.",

        outline: "P2Y receptors are a family of eight G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are activated by nucleotides such as ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP. They are present in almost all human cells and play various roles in physiological and pathological processes, including in the regulation of vascular tone, platelet aggregation, response to inflammation, neurotransmission, and pain perception. As is the case with other GPCR, crystal structures have yielded substantial insights into the structure and activation mechanisms of P2Y receptors, though to date, only the tertiary structures of two (P2Y1 and P2Y12) have been determined experimentally. Some groups have thus attempted to gain structural insights of the remaining six receptors, primarily through homology modelling and computational chemistry-based computer simulations supported by mutagenesis studies. Since the publication of the first iteration of AlphaFold in 2020, it has been heralded as a landmark in de novo protein structure prediction. Developed by Google’s DeepMind, AlphaFold comprised an entirely new kind of software, in that it was first and foremost an AI-driven neural network. It was trained using vast quantities of data to make accurate predictions of distances between pairs of residues, and was more powerful than existing methodologies. In mid-2024, DeepMind published the third generation of this software (AF3), which, in addition to further accuracy-improving refinements, is also believed to be able to predict the interactions of proteins, the effects of point mutations, of post-translational modifications and, in some cases, make predictions about the nature of ligand binding sites.",

In 2012 Dixon discovered a novel mode of non-apoptotic, necrotic cell death where iron  dependent induced lipid reactive oxygen species resulted in lethal cell membrane rupture termed ferroptosis. Over the last ten years it has been shown that in many inflammatory diseases including Type1 diabetes, liver fibrosis, cancers (e.g. lung, liver, pancreatic and colorectal) and neurological diseases such as stroke, Alzheimer’s  and Parkinson’s  disease ferroptosis plays a role in disease occurrence and progression. The World Health Organisation released figures in 2019 stating that antimicrobial resistance was responsible for 4.95 million deaths globally and renewed their great concern that there was only a small pipeline of potential new antimicrobials available. In the last three years, there has been evidence that ferroptosis modulators may have potential use as anti-microbial agents. Although this research is still in its infancy, it has been shown that some pathogenic organisms hi-jack the host ferroptosis processes to  aid their replication and pathogenesis.",

Research evidence suggests that increased levels of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide accumulation and neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to the dysfunction and death of neurons during the development of AD. Therefore, novel therapies may be developed through reducing the accumulation of Aβ and modulating the complex neuroinflammation mediated by microglia and other immune cells. Nanoparticles are emerging as a new class of therapeutics for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases because of their multifunctionality in drug delivery, encapsulating compounds, and as immunomodulatory agents. Ultrasmall lysozyme encapsulated gold nanoclusters (Ly-AuNCs) are shown to inhibit the aggregation of Aβ in vitro, thus might be a potential therapeutic agent for AD. However the effect of Ly-AuNCs on neuroinflammation is not known. Here we propose to investigate how Ly-AuNCs interact with microglia and whether they change the phenotype and function of microglial cells.

The development of the Mesolens, an optical system uniquely capable of imaging individual bacteria across an unusually large field of view, now allows us to examine the architecture of mature Escherichia coli macro-colony biofilms in unprecedented detail. Using the Mesolens, we observed intra-colony channels with a diameter of approximately 10 μm, which emerge as a natural consequence of biofilm growth. These channels have been shown to play a crucial role in nutrient transport throughout the biofilm, but their cell-channel boundary has not been structurally analyzed. Understanding this boundary could provide invaluable insights into the channels' function.",

Examples of such RNA structures include Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES), frameshift signals, RNA pseudoknots, and other regulatory elements. These structures are not only critical for viral replication but also represent potential targets for antiviral drug development. The ability to target these viral RNA elements with small molecules could lead to novel therapeutic strategies. To explore this possibility, a dual-luciferase reporter system can be employed. This system allows researchers to insert viral RNA elements upstream of luciferase genes, enabling the assessment of how these elements influence translation. By measuring the activity of two luciferases—firefly and Renilla—researchers can normalize the data and accurately determine the effect of the viral RNA structure on translation.",

        outline: "Cells can compartmentalise processes by encompassing key machinery within membrane vesicles. The delivery of these vesicles to different compartments relies on the fusion of one membrane with another – an energetically expensive process. Cells therefore need to posses mechanisms to ensure both the specificity of the fusion process (i.e. to make sure the membrane vesicle fuses at the correct location) and act a means to control this fusion. This project will consider the mechanisms which underlie regulation of fusion. Key to communication between intracellular membrane compartments by vesicle trafficking are components of the SNARE machinery [1, 2]. Studies from several groups, including our own [3], have identified phosphorylation as a potential means to control the SNARE machinery, with emphasis on a sub-set of SNAREs called Qa SNAREs [1, 2]. Qa SNAREs are controlled by interaction with members of the Sec1/Munc18 family of proteins, but we understand little about how these proteins interact. However, so recent studies have further extended this understanding [4, 5]. This project will consider how this control may arise, using a range of bioinformatics and protein prediction tools to consider the mechanistic basis for this effect, and to establish whether this may be a wide-spread regulatory mechanism across biological kingdoms. It is designed for two students to work together.",

HMGB1 is a nuclear protein that can translocate to the cytoplasm and be passively or actively released from the cell. In paediatric tonsils, elevated levels of HMGB1 might indicate an ongoing inflammatory response. Studies have shown that HMGB1 levels are often elevated in tissues undergoing inflammation, including the tonsils during episodes of tonsillitis. Interestingly, the Cunningham-McConnell laboratories have identified different patterns of HMGB1 expression across paediatric patient tonsil samples.

Establishing the safety profile of a new drug is a complex process that continues long after it reaches the market, often requiring several years of real-world use before safety can be fully assessed. Thus, authorities such as the FDA in the US and MHRA in the UK continually monitor and report on ADRs. Meta-analysis has become a widely used method for identifying adverse effects of drugs and vaccines. In many ways, meta-analysis is particularly well-suited for this purpose. Efficacy studies typically lack the size necessary to accurately assess risks that emerge when a medication is broadly administered. Meta-analysis, with its statistical efficiency in combining data from multiple studies, offers a natural solution for uncovering these potential risks.",

Most of these deaths, 0.9 million, were caused by the six leading bacterial pathogens associated with antibiotic resistant infections; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This project is focused on P. aeruginosa a major cause of hospital acquired infections such as ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia and catheter-associated urinary tract infections. A major and rapidly growing problem in treating P. aeruginosa infection is antibiotic resistance. Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa with resistance to nearly all available antibiotics are prevalent worldwide and between 18 and 25% of clinical isolates are multidrug resistant, showing resistance to three or more frontline antibiotics. An alternative strategy for antibiotic discovery is to utilize the narrow spectrum antibiotics used by bacteria for intraspecies competition. In Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae these take the form of related high molecular weight protein antibiotics (bacteriocins), termed pyocins, colicins and klebicins, respectively. The use of bacteriocins will, in contrast to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, allow specific pathogens to be targeted leaving the wider microbial community intact. The devastating impact of conventional antibiotics on the structure, composition and functionality of human microbiomes is now recognised with increased antibiotic use in early life associated with an increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases such as IBD and asthma in later life. The aim of this project is to utilize bioinformatics to discover new pyocins and make structural predictions to delineate domain structure and infer potential mechanisms of action.",

We have previously investigated the role of one PAR subtype, PAR2, in CNS function revealing that its activation modulates neuronal excitability2, is neuroprotective3 and plays a role in sickness behaviour4.  In addition, we have shown that a PAR2 activator, AC264613, that crosses the blood brain barrier, induces depression-like behaviour in mice5.  However, novel PAR2 inhibitors have recently been developed6,7 yet these have not been characterised against AC264613 or in CNS preparations.  Given PAR2 activation induces depression-like behaviour, our lab hypothesises that PAR2 inhibitors will ameliorate depression-like behaviour. However, whether the proposed PAR2 inhibitor, AZ8838, selectively inhibits PAR2 in CNS-relevant preparations is unknown.",
        aim: "Thus the aim of this project is test this hypothesis by examining the following research questions: 1.	Does the PAR2 inhibitor, AZ8838, inhibit AC26461-induced internalisation of PAR2? 2.	Does AZ8838 inhibit PAR2-mediated activation of signalling pathways? Answers to these questions will improve our understanding of the selectivity of the PAR2 inhibitor and potentially highlight its use as a novel therapeutic for the treatment of CNS disorders.",

In 2012, Dixon et al discovered a novel mode of non-apoptotic, necrotic cell death termed ferroptosis which is characterised by iron dependent induced lipid reactive oxygen species. A unique property of ferroptosis over other forms of cell death is that an  increase in cellular Fe2+ level is detected. Over the last twelve years it has been shown that in many inflammatory diseases including cancers such as lung, liver, pancreatic and colorectal  ferroptosis plays a role in disease occurrence and progression. Although, prostate cancer survival is 95% at 5 years if diagnosed at an early stage, there is still a cohort of patients who are initially  diagnosed with metastatic disease which show a mortality rate of around 50% at 5 years.  Novel drugs are to successfully fight this cancer for this group of patients. Although much is still unknown about the actions of ferroptosis in cancers, ferroptosis inducers have shown early promise to be useful additions to the arsenal of anti-cancer therapies against prostate cancer. The discovery of a ferroptosis-inducing compound called erastin,  which  acts through cystine-glutamine exchange transporter (System XC) can be used as a drug discovery tool to evaluate induction of ferroptosis in cancer cells.",

Indeed, studies using cultured human astrocytes have revealed similar pro-inflammatory expression profiles to those seen in post-mortem tissue1,2.  Similarly, proteinase-activated receptors (PARs) have been implicated in various inflammation-related diseases in both the periphery and central nervous system (CNS)3.  We have previously shown in rodent tissue that PAR2-mediated neuroprotection and neuromodulation is astrocyte mediated4-6 and we have novel data showing PAR2 is present on cultured human astrocytes.  However, whether astrocytic PAR2 activation modulates the astrocytic phagocytosis is unknown.  Hence, we hypothesise that PAR2 activation will increase the phagocytotic activity of cultured human astrocytes.",
        aim: "Thus the aim of this project is to test this hypothesis by examining the following research questions: 1.	Does PAR2 activation alter phagocytotic activity in naïve cultured human astrocytes? 2.	Does PAR2 activation alter phagocytotic activity in reactive astrocytes ? Answers to these questions will improve our understanding of how astrocytic PAR2 activation is protective when examined in several animal models of disease.",

The latter involves the attachment of fatty acids onto cysteines and regulates the localisation and stability of proteins. Defects in S-acylation are linked to cancer, diabetes, and neurological disorders. S-Acylation is mediated by a family of “zDHHC” enzymes and current research on this process is severely hindered by the lack of compounds and molecules to mediate the selective inhibition of specific zDHHC isoforms. This project aims to develop molecules that interfere with zDHHC17, a key enzyme linked to cancer, diabetes, and Huntington’s disease. We have identified a specific substrate sequence (a 6-amino acid peptide) that is recognised by zDHHC17 and have used this peptide to disrupt the S-acylation of proteins by zDHHC17. This project will take these inhibitory amino acid peptides and explore how targeting them to the Golgi apparatus (where zDHHC17 is localised) affects their inhibitory properties. The hypothesis is that these Golgi-targeted peptides will display enhanced potency as selective inhibitors of zDHHC17. To explore these questions, enzyme-substrate interactions will be examined using techniques including immunoprecipitation and click chemistry.",

For the past two decades, many laboratories have focused on developing novel treatment strategies to improve the poor survival rates of glioblastoma patients. However, despite these efforts, all new treatments have failed to enhance patient outcomes, raising the question: why are these cancer cells so resistant to treatment? While the biological mechanisms behind the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of drugs have been extensively studied in several cancer models, there is still relatively little understanding of glioblastoma cells respond to these drug-induced effects and which response might be more effective in improving tumour outcomes and clinically relevant. In our laboratory, we have identified drugs that target the cholesterol synthesis pathway at both early and late stages, effectively inhibiting cell proliferation. In this project, you will explore the mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative effects of these drugs and determine whether they induce cytotoxicity or cytostasis. Your findings will provide insights into potential new therapies and clarify the role of cytostasis in glioblastoma treatment resistance.",

Different approaches have been used to elucidate tumour incidence and progression, from studying driver mutations, interactions between the different cellular and physical components within the tumour microenvironment, as well as environmental drivers of disease, to be able to design treatment options (1). During tumour development, cancers modulate the body’s immune response, namely the disruption of lymph node functions (2,3). This is accomplished by the drainage of tumour-derived factors to the lymph nodes. Several of these components have been identified, but their effect within tumour-draining lymph nodes, or directly onto immune cell function, has not yet been determined. This project aims to identify the effect the effects of tumour-derived factors in immune response that ultimately enables breast cancer progression.

        outline: "A collection of 93 atypical Salmonella were recovered from commercial food production/livestock and exotic animals in Colombia. The most prevalent serovar identified by traditional serotyping methods was Salmonella Uganda. Salmonella enterica serovar Uganda (S. Uganda) is an increasing cause of acute foodborne disease outbreaks. These strains were all found to be resistant to five or more classes of antimicrobial agents. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of these isolates identified a range of genetic differences when compared with S. Typhimurium. This suggests S. Uganda represents a high-risk, emerging hazard for foodborne antimicrobial resistant (AMR) infections and could result in difficult to treat clinical cases.",

        outline: "The silent pandemic of antibiotic resistance was responsible for 1.27 million deaths in 2019. Most of these deaths, 0.9 million, were caused by the six leading bacterial pathogens associated with antibiotic resistant infections; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This project is focused on P. aeruginosa a major cause of hospital acquired infections such as ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia and catheter-associated urinary tract infections. A major and rapidly growing problem in treating P. aeruginosa infection is antibiotic resistance. Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa with resistance to nearly all available antibiotics are prevalent worldwide and between 18 and 25% of clinical isolates are multidrug resistant, showing resistance to three or more frontline antibiotics. An alternative strategy for antibiotic discovery is to utilize the narrow spectrum antibiotics used by bacteria for intraspecies competition. In Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae these take the form of related high molecular weight protein antibiotics (bacteriocins), termed pyocins, colicins and klebicins, respectively. The use of bacteriocins will, in contrast to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, allow specific pathogens to be targeted leaving the wider microbial community intact. The devastating impact of conventional antibiotics on the structure, composition and functionality of human microbiomes is now recognised with increased antibiotic use in early life associated with an increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases such as IBD and asthma in later life. The aim of this project is to engineer novel pyocins with a broad activity against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates including antibiotic resistant isolates.",
        aim: "The overall aim of this project is to engineer chimeric pyocins in which the pyocin cytotoxic domain has been replaced by the cytotoxic domain of a colicin or klebicin. This will ensure that there is no immunity protein based resistance in the Pseudomonas aeruginosa population. The specific aims are: 1. Create expression vectors encoding chimeric bacteriocins 2. Express and purify chimeric bacteriocins 3. Test the killing activity of chimeric bacteriocins against P. aeruginosa isolates",

        outline: "People like me have been telling you for three years that the journeys from DNA to mRNA (transcription) and from mRNA to protein (translation) are straightforward information transfer and information accuracy processes. The words we use like ‘coding’ and ‘sequence data’ and ‘mutation’ reinforce this way of thinking. However, if you stop to think about it, both of these 'expression' stages are gargantuan polymerisation reactions taking place within closed vessels (the nucleus, the cell cytoplasm). If you now think back to your reaction kinetics lectures, you’ll remember that substrate concentration is a really important (and often limiting) factor in determining the rate of an enzymatic reaction. In that context, the availability of amino acids (remembering that some we make well, some we don’t make well, and some we can’t make but instead must acquire through our diet) is potentially important for translation. In the same way, the availability of the mRNA bases C, A, G, and U will also be important for transcription. If you don’t have the right building-blocks, then expression levels will be negatively affected. There’s a second, equally important, side to this story: if your cells were short of the amino acid tyrosine, but the protein that you were trying to translate has no tyrosines in its sequence, its expression will not be affected. But what if it was full of tyrosines? Therefore, we might propose that expression is operating as a ‘supply and demand’ paradigm: the supply of the building blocks, and the specific and individual demands from the sequences of each mRNA or protein. The upshot is that mRNA expression levels are going to change not only based on promoter activity, but also based how efficiently the mRNA polymer can be made. This isn’t just the theoretical ramblings of a lecturer in his twilight years: we have found strong evidence from public proteomic datasets to support this model in translation (Thompson & Pickard, in press) and I have now shown that exactly the same thing occurs in transcription. In fact, the supply and demand model in mRNA transcription seems to be a hugely important factor in mouse, rat, and human drug response/side-effects, disease pathology (schizophrenia/autism/multiple sclerosis/rheumatoid arthritis/cancer etc), viral infection, and the expression profile differences between organs and stages of development. I’m exaggerating, or high on Excel spreadsheets, but this throws 30 years of gene expression analysis out the window: the important action is not happening at the level of individual genes but at the level of this previously invisible global regulation of the entire transcriptome. Importantly, this paradigm isn’t all bad - it's not about austerity and cost-of-expression in a negative sense. The transcriptome has evolved in sequence composition so that it can be purposefully and usefully regulated by subtle shifts in nucleobase availability, so I would place the paradigm well and truly within the normal, homeostatic control of our biology – as well as being a potentially important source of pathology.",

        outline: "Infectious diseases caused by microbial pathogens have, until the advent of antibiotic treatment in the 20th Century, been the most common cause of death in humans throughout history (Balloux & van Dorp, 2017). Microbial pathogens also continue to be the major biotic threat to global crop production (Almeida et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2022). Interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts - both attack and defence - can be mediated by small (e.g. secondary metabolites) and large (e.g. proteins) molecules (Teixeira et al., 2019; Olive & Sassetti, 2016). Genome sequencing produces a very large number of microbial genome sequences, enabling the identification and discovery of many candidate genes whose protein products are expected to mediate interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts (Davey & Valdivia, 2019; Urban et al., 2022). This allows for extensive and wide-ranging evolutionary studies of proteins involved in pathogenicity. However, understanding the relationship of sequence variation to protein function requires knowledge of 3D protein structure, but experimental structure determination has not kept up the same rate as sequencing approaches. The AlphaFold AI, and variations on AlphaFold, promise great advances in protein structure prediction. They produce, in many cases, candidate structures that are accurate at atomic level to experimentally-derived structures (Jumper et al., 2021). In conjunction with the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the AlphaFoldDB server provides predicted structures for almost all proteins in UniProt (https://www.alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). This enables the extension of many bioinformatic approaches for investigating relationships between evolution, sequence, and function biologically-important molecules that do not have an experimentally-solved 3D structure, with groundbreaking implications for drug targeting, and understanding fundamental host-pathogen interactions. In this project, up to six students will each work with a different virulence-related protein from an important pathogen species. They will use an AlphaFold-predicted structure for their protein to help interpret its evolutionary history and suggest candidate functional and/or druggable sites. Approaches that might be taken during the course of the project include: - sequence-based search and enumeration of known homologues/orthologues - comparison of structural predictions for related proteins, and structural identification of remote homologues - evolutionary analysis/phylogenetic reconstruction of pathogen proteins - prediction of conserved functional sites by mapping sequence variation onto predicted structure - identification of coevolving sites",

        outline: "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, released from cells of the cardiovascular system are very important in intercellular communication and in maintaining healthy cardiac function. EVs contain a range of bioactive molecules that can exert phenotypic and functional effects on neighbouring cells and can change their composition during pathophysiological conditions. These changes can help promote the progression of disease. As such, EVs are important biological communicators and could be valuable as biomarkers for CV disease in the future. Given the ability of EVs to transport bioactive molecules, there is also the potential that EVs could be used for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of cardiovascular conditions. For example, vesicles from different stem cells/progenitor cells have shown encouraging results in preclinical models and there is the possibility that exosomes may be used as drug carriers. The current literature in this area is growing and there is a real urgency to improve our understanding not just of how EVs contribute to CV health and disease but how we can improve techniques to effectively study them.",

        outline: "Enterococci are Gram positive bacteria that form part of the healthy gut flora of humans and animals, but they are also important causes of opportunistic infections. Urinary tract and bloodstream infections caused by these organisms are becoming increasingly common in the clinic, with recent data indicating that rates of enterococcal bacteraemia rose from 9.7 cases/100,000 population to 15.9 cases/100,000 population in England between 2013 and 2021. Furthermore, treatment of enterococcal infections is complicated by the fact that these organisms increasing exhibit antibiotic resistance. These factors mean that it is important for us to gain a deeper understanding of both the mechanisms that are important for enterococcal virulence and for the spread of antibiotic resistance. Plasmids are episomal segments of DNA that frequently harbour virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes. Importantly, plasmids can be transferred between bacteria through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), enabling exchange of pathogenic or resistant traits between highly virulent and benign bacterial strains. These projects will seek to characterise key features of plasmids carried by the two species of Enterococcus most frequently associated with invasive disease: Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. You will use web-based bioinformatic approaches to interrogate the genome sequences of one of these species to determine key features of their plasmids, such as the frequency of plasmid carriage, the type of antibiotic resistance and virulence factors genes associated with their plasmids (e.g. ABRicate, VirProfile2, CARD), and the mechanisms that the plasmids may use for HGT (e.g. oriT Finder, CONJscan).",

Traditional vaccines often employ a “one size fits all” approach and fail to consider individual variability. Personalised vaccines have been shown to play a pivotal role in treating malignant tumours, where they are designed to trigger T cell responses against neoantigens. Neoantigen vaccines are highly specific to a patient and are designed to stimulate the patient's immune system to recognise and attack cancer cells more selectively. However, limitations to this approach include neoantigen identification challenges, time delays and high manufacturing costs. To overcome these barriers, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are being applied to identify neoantigens and evaluate their immunogenicity.  AI models are also streamlining the development of personalised vaccines by optimising mRNA vaccine design, predicting T-cell receptor specificity and revolutionising adjuvant identifications.",

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), otherwise known as natively unstructured proteins, or transiently structured proteins, account for 5% of the human proteome, and around 60% of all proteins contain at least one disordered region [1]. These proteins and protein regions have significant roles in cell signalling, ligand binding, and are even implicated in human disease [2, 3, 4]. Due to their heterogeneous nature, they are difficult to study using standard structural biology techniques such as x-ray crystallography. However, the advent of protein structure prediction software such as AlphaFold, has enhanced the structural biology toolkit for proteins that can be challenging to study experimentally [5, 6]. This project will start with a literature review of the intrinsically disordered proteome landscape. You will then use AlphaFold to conduct structure predictions using several proteins of your choice. You will then assess the quality of the models produced by AlphaFold and compare them to other predictors of protein disorder using multiple web-based bioinformatics servers.",

However, these approaches often fall short in accurately replicating the complexity of human physiology, particularly when considering interactions across multiple organ systems. Enter the \"human body-on-a-chip\" technology [1-3] —a revolutionary advancement in biomedical engineering that mimics the functions of various human organs on a microscale, interconnected platform. This project aims to explore the potential of human body-on-a-chip systems in advancing pharmacological research to the multi-system level. These microfluidic devices simulate the dynamic environments of human organs, allowing for the study of drug metabolism, efficacy, and toxicity in a controlled, physiologically relevant context. By integrating multiple organ models on a single chip, this technology provides a comprehensive view of how drugs interact across different systems, offering insights that are difficult to achieve with traditional methods. Through this project, we will investigate how body-on-a-chip technology can be utilized to enhance drug development processes, reduce the reliance on animal testing, and provide more accurate predictions of human responses. The outcomes could pave the way for more personalized and effective treatments, ultimately revolutionizing the field of pharmacology.

Understanding the basic biology of these systems, such as restriction modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, has allowed the development of tools that are now indispensable to the fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology. The characterisation and understanding of bacterial defence systems are not only vital to our understanding of bacteria-phage co-evolution but also have the potential to both provide new methods of controlling phage infections in biotechnological and agricultural settings and to produce novel molecular biological tools [2,3,4,5,6]. Bacterial defence systems are mechanistically diverse but follow an established pattern: a cell is infected; a defence mechanism prevents phage replication; and the cell survives to reproduce, or in dying prevents amplification of phage that could then infect other cells. However, members of the multicellular bacterial genus Streptomyces carry a number of viral defence systems that are currently unclassified. This project will isolate new bacteriophages from the environment and use mutants in defence system to understand how they respond to phage infection, and ultimately prevents phage replication.",

Alterations in oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, such as p53 and KRAS, disrupt normal cell cycle control, leading to the transformation of healthy cells into cancerous ones. Targeted therapies are treatments that specifically focus on altered or overexpressed proteins in cancer cells, providing benefits to many patients. Typically, targeted anti-cancer drugs are first approved for a specific type of cancer with the relevant gene or protein alteration. To expand their use to other cancer types, further clinical trials are conducted. For instance, KRAS inhibitors like sotorasib and adagrasib are approved for treating non-small cell lung cancer with a KRAS G12C mutation and are now being tested in trials for pancreatic and colorectal cancers with KRAS G12C mutations. Similarly, IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors, ivosidenib and enasidenib, are approved for IDH1/IDH2 mutant acute myeloid leukemia and are currently under trial for treating glioblastoma with the same mutations. Before initiating trials, publicly available cancer genomic databases are used to gather information such as the prevalence of the desired mutation or over expressed protein within the patient population, potential co-mutations that could affect treatment response, and the prognostic and predictive value of the mutation on disease progression.",

The Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework is an inclusive learning approach used to reduce barriers faced by those that require additional support for learning (ASL) in the classroom. The framework has been argued to attract those requiring ASL to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and ensure their success in these subjects (Griffiths, 2021). This project is part of an active collaboration with Dr Jane Essex (Institute of Education, Strathclyde) as part of a current Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Impact Acceleration Account (IAA) funded Project: “Understanding health and informing lifestyle choices: making sense of research” and will follow on from previous funded work (EPSRC IAA: Engineering equity in STEM employment and Sustainable impact by design: a pilot study of effective EPSRC/ STEM Equals: STEM dissemination for hard-to-reach audiences).

The role of pituitary GnRH receptors in the control of reproductive functions is well established, with emerging roles in hormone-dependent tumours [2], which has led to the development of new ways to target GnRH1R in cancer [3]. This project is part of an ongoing collaboration between Dr Paul Mulheran (Chemical and Process Engineering, Strathclyde), Dr Val Ferro (SIPBS) and the Cunningham laboratory.  Recent work in Mulheran’s group has studied the interactions between native GnRH and its cognate receptor, GnRH1R, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GnRH1R has recently been successfully modelled by the research team, revealing a new mechanism for how GnRH activates it and how analogs could replicate this action. Resolution of the structure of the human GnRH1R has revealed an unusual ligand binding mode [4], however new insights gained from the Mulheran lab suggest that alterations in GnRH1R receptor trafficking may be important for its unique receptor pharmacology.",

        outline: "Transient rises in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) provide a major trigger for numerous aspects of smooth muscle and endothelial activity including cell division, growth, metabolism, contraction and death. Smooth muscle and endothelial cells have developed a plethora of Ca2+-sensitive signal-transducing systems to enable them to control the many and diverse processes managed by the ion. This control imposes a spatial restriction on signalling procedures which requires a privileged delivery of Ca2+ to certain regions of the cell to produce a local [Ca2+] which differs from the average cytoplasmic values of the ion i.e. localized Ca2+ signals. The unique availability of Ca2+ in certain regions of the cell enables smooth muscle and endothelail cells to control the many and diverse Ca2+ sensitive signal-transducing systems managed by the ion. Localized signals may allow the entire cell to function through the operation of different, even opposing, activities which occur simultaneously in various parts of the cell. Two key features of the cell promote the formation of such localized Ca2+ signals (a) the close proximity of cellular organelles (e.g. plasmalemma, SR and mitochondria) to each other and/or to other organelles. This promotes regions of restricted diffusion of Ca2+ and with it higher, or lower, concentrations of the ion in those regions than in other areas of the cell. (b) Localized feedback mechanisms which act on Ca2+ either entering the cell or being released from the SR and which permit regional control of the [Ca2+]. For example, part of the SR lies in close proximity to the plasmalemma; some mitochondria are close to both the SR and plasmalemma. This critical analysis project will attempt to develop a consensus on the mechanisms which allow development of local Ca2+ signals, the role of organelles and the possible drug targets offered by each pathway to control the Ca2+ signal in vascular disease.",

        outline: "Despite prescribed drugs such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor) used in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD remains the single biggest killer in the western world. While there are multiple causes of cardiovascular disease, most develop as a consequence of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is promoted by factors such as oxidation of LDL cholesterol, accumulation of that oxidized fat in arterial walls, and damage to the endothelium, which is the thin layer of cells lining those arterial walls. The most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug is metformin is now known to prevent these early steps in atherosclerosis development. Metformin has been in use in the UK since 1958 and in the United States since 1995. One of the key ways it does this is by activating the metabolic regulator AMPK. By activating AMPK, metformin diminishes LDL oxidation and the reducing endothelial dysfunction, which slows the development of atherosclerosis. Importantly, metformin has also been shown to prevent dysfunction of endothelial cells and which is well established as an important precursor of atherosclerosis. The results of cardiovascular protective effects of metformin have been seen in numerous human studies. In one study, myocardial infarction (MI) patients taking metformin had a significant 75% reduction in the risk of dying after 30 days, and a 68% reduction in their risk of dying 12 months post MI. Several studies have also demonstrated that metformin reduces the risk of heart attack, and is associated with reduction in stroke, atrial fibrillation (an arrhythmia), and death from all causes. A recent 2016 study showed significant reductions in systolic blood pressure in nondiabetic people taking metformin. Significantly, the largest reductions were seen in those having impaired glucose tolerance or obesity.",

LV is commonly assumed to have normal function and structure in PAH and is less studied in PAH. Some studies have reveals changes in both LV function and structure. This project will measure fibrosis and myocyte size in LV free wall and septum using histological staining on tissues from animal model of PAH with and without treatment of an antioxidant drug.

However, all conventional opioid analgesics are associated with a wide range of side effects, from the mild (itching) to moderate (constipation and sedation) to severe (respiratory depression and habituation). These side effects can seriously compromise the effective use of opioids as analgesics. Not surprisingly, for many years it has been the desire of medical scientists to develop strategies for the use of opioids that maximise their beneficial analgesic properties whilst limiting their unwanted side effects. These strategies to maximise therapeutic effectiveness have included, but are not limited to: development of new opioid ligands with novel pharmacological profiles; development of new clinical/therapeutic use strategies for opioids; development of novel opioid formulations. In this project, students will chose a novel area of opioid clinical use and/or pharmacological development of interest.

Despite the selectivity of the antibody component in binding to extracellular targets, there are considerable costs and translational challenges in their development. Investment in the early-stage design and development of bioconjugates is now needed to fast track their progression to in vivo applications. A major challenge in ADC development is identifying key critical quality attributes of the bioconjugate for parenteral administration. We will assess the role of linker stability, the impact of percentage unbound payload/Ab fraction and bioconjugate parameters (e.g., monomeric purity, aggregation, stability) and how these attributes influence biological activity.3 In this studentship project, using novel analytical methodologies based on flow-field flow fractionation-based separation and in-line analysis and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry pipelines, we plan to study the drug-to-antibody ratio and purity profile of ADCs with different linker chemistries (e.g., maleimide).

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common nasopharyngeal commensal but is also the most common cause of pneumonia globally. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is responsible for almost one million deaths worldwide in children under the age of 5 each year. In contrast, Streptococcus mitis, the closest genetic relative of S. pneumoniae, is a common respiratory tract commensal most often found in the oropharynx. Despite the close genetic relationship, S. mitis has weak virulence potential when compared to S. pneumoniae. The advent of WGS has generated an abundance of genomic data for S. pneumoniae, with comparative genomics identifying a number of genes likely to contribute to the differential virulence of S. pneumoniae and S. mitis.

Tiling involves capturing adjacent, overlapping sections of a sample, each representing a different field of view. These individual images, or \"tiles,\" are then stitched together using software that aligns the overlapping areas, compensating for any distortions or shifts. The result is a composite image that covers a broader area than a single field of view would allow, while maintaining the detailed resolution of the smaller images. However, these techniques have limitations, including potential artifacts at the stitching boundaries, inconsistencies in lighting across tiles, and the time-consuming nature of the process. Additionally, the large data sets generated require substantial computational resources for processing and storage. These challenges can affect the accuracy and efficiency of image reconstruction, particularly in complex specimens. Various algorithms are used in stitching and tiling for light microscopy to ensure accurate image alignment and seamless integration. Feature-based algorithms detect and match key points across overlapping regions, effectively aligning images with minimal distortion. Intensity-based algorithms use pixel values to optimize overlap and blending, ensuring consistent brightness and contrast across the stitched image. More advanced approaches, like multi-scale or pyramid-based methods, handle variations in scale and rotation by processing images at different resolutions. These algorithms are crucial for minimizing artefacts and achieving high-quality composite images.",

Extracts of Parinari curatellifolia have been used as a traditional medicine in Sub-Saharan Africa for the management of various ailments like cancer, diabetes, pneumonia, and inflammatory conditions [9]. Phytochemical screening of this plant indicated that it contained compounds including polyphenol, vitamin C and other secondary metabolites, such as alkaloid, anthraquinones, and glycosides which could contribute to its antioxidant properties [9-11]. Thus, this plant may exert an antidiabetic activity through its antioxidant properties as there is a strong link between oxidative stress and type-2 diabetes.",

However, more recently it has been recognised that prostaglandins, particularly PGE2 can suppress the production of the main inflammatory mediators, specifically tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in a negative-feedback regulation and PGE2 has been shown to be one of the most potent immunoregulatory mediators so far studied [1, 2], with the ability to completely abolish many immune cell activities. In addition to inhibiting cytokine release prostanoids can also suppress the cell pathology induced by TNF-α i.e. preventing cell death [1]. They appear to have cytoprotective properties. There are many different series of prostaglandins in addition to PGE2 such as PGD2 and the more recently discovered PGE2-ethanolamide (from anandamide the ethanolamide derivative of arachidonic acid [3]). The fatty acid-ethanolamides can also be antiproliferative, which is important in the control of cancer cells and have already been shown to control the growth of solid cancers [4]. This raises the question of whether other fatty acid acid-derived lipids that can be synthesised during immune responses, can also regulate cell survival responses and if so the nature/ mechanisms by which they do so.",

Despite the considerable resources being invested into the discovery of new cancer drugs, novel therapies suffer from high failure rates, high cost, limited efficacy and a lengthy timeline before they become clinically available. None of this is good for the cancer patient. One approach to circumvent this problem is to repurpose existing non-cancer or cancer drugs against cancers to provide new or novel therapies which could reduce costs, enhance tumour specificity, reduce toxicity or rapidly accelerate the introduction of new therapies into clinical practice.

Ammonium exchange is mediated by the ubiquitous ammonium transporter/methylammonium permease/Rhesus (Amt/Mep/Rh) protein family. The major role of bacterial, fungal, and plant Amt/Mep proteins is to scavenge ammonium for biosynthetic assimilation, whereas mammals are thought to express Rh proteins to detoxify erythrocytes, kidney, and liver cells. Members of the Amt/Mep/Rh family have also been found to be important drivers of the virulence of infectious fungi. In humans, Rh mutations are linked to pathologies that include inherited hemolytic anemia, stomatocytosis, and early-onset depressive disorder. Despite this key general and biomedical importance, so far, no consensus on the pathway and mechanism of ammonium transport by the Amt/Mep/Rh family has been reached",

One of the pathogens listed as ‘critical’ priority are the Enterobacteriaceae, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461). Kpn is a gram-negative bacterium that can thrive in the environment and as commensal in the human gut, but is causing a rapidly increasing number of difficult-to-treat infections in hospital-acquired infections and is one of the leading causes of neonatal sepsis in low-income settings (Sands et al 2021). Our increased understanding of its diversity highlighted that Kpn is however a species complex comprised of several species and sub-species (Rodrigues et al 2019); and whilst Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae is the main cause of infections, ~5-10% of hospital-associated infection isolates diagnosed as Kpn are usually comprised of K. variicola and/or K. quasipneumoniae. However, as the main efforts in research and public health are on K. pneumoniae pneumoniae (Wyres et al 2020), we have limited understanding of which sequence types or subspecies of K. variicola and K. quasipneumoniae are problematic causing within-hospital infections, or if the infectious isolates are just representing the local diversity and no specific sequence types occur repeatedly. You will assess the recent literature for large-scale collections of Kpn genome studies (mainly hospital-associated infection surveillance and large-scale infectious pathogen surveillance), as well as functional or other descriptive studies of these species. You will collect the associated K. variicola or K. quasipneumoniae data, making critical notes of the limitations of each study considering selection criteria and potential biases (patient population, sampling time, selection of isolates based on resistance profiles) and try to account for the significant bias in geographical spread in published data. You will then assess the resistance profiles, hypermucoid virulence factors, capsule- and O-antigen types (putative vaccine targets under development) and sequence types, and formulate a hypothesis whether any specific sequence types (and if yes, describe these) seem to be globally spreading and should be monitored, and critically discuss these in light of the limitations of the respective studies and how much this impacts our understanding of the global picture.",

Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy offers the possibility to quantitatively assess the amount of collagen in the tonsil without labelling, and unpublished results show that the amount of immature collagen differs between tonsils from patients with ART and OSA. However, because the tonsil is too large to be imaged with a microscope while revealing the collagen bundles, computational stitching and tiling methods are required, and these can introduce artefacts into the data, and the downstream analysis.",

        outline: "During inflammation there are a sequence of inflammatory mediators which are produced by immune cells which enter the systemic circulation and are able to affect the whole body. Infectious agents stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1. These in turn result in the production of secondary mediators especially prostaglandins. These PGs can limit the extent of inflammation but are also responsible for the end symptoms. The effects of the novel PGs is less clear as is their interaction with the upstream cytokines. This provides potential targets for novel anti-inflammatory therapies based on PG receptors. In addition, some chronic immune mechanisms recently described which involve T cell derived cytokines/ mediators may provide some insight into therapeutic targets. It is intended to evaluate evidence which points to novel targets for therapy especially those which alter either acute, or more likely, chronic immune responses involving adaptive immune interactions such as T cells and their cytokines/ signalling.",
        aim: "The specific aims of the project are to evaluate the experimental evidence which points to specific immune mechanisms which may have potential as targets for therapy in comparison to existing treatments which have severe limitations. The project must focus on research evidence which shows pathways (e.g. novel cytokines or singling mechanisms) that have the potential to suppress either acute or chronic inflammation. Students will be free to focus on a particular disease of their choice which has an inflammatory pathology. Project Area Immunology References AUSTERMANN J, ROTH J, & Barczyk-Kahlert K (2022).

        outline: "Voice prosthetic devices are used to help individuals who have undergone a laryngectomy—removal of the voice box—regain their ability to speak. These devices create a passage between the trachea and oesophagus, allowing air to be directed from the lungs through the oesophagus, where it can be shaped into speech. Leakage in voice prosthetic devices occurs when fluids, such as saliva or liquids consumed by the patient, pass through the prosthesis from the oesophagus into the trachea. This can lead to serious complications, including increased risk of aspiration, respiratory infections, and discomfort for the patient. Additionally, leakage can impair the device's function, affecting the patient's ability to speak clearly. Proper maintenance and timely replacement of the prosthesis are essential to prevent leakage and ensure the device's effectiveness. Biofilms are thought to play a significant role in leakage in voice prosthetic devices. A biofilm is a complex aggregation of microorganisms, primarily bacteria and fungi, that adhere to the surface of the prosthetic device and secrete a protective matrix. Over time, biofilms can develop on the surface of voice prostheses, particularly in the moist environment of the throat.",

        outline: "Fusobacterium nucleatum is an opportunistic pathogen in the oral microbiome and has been linked to poor prognosis in multiple types of cancer, including colorectal cancer. A key pathogenic trait of F. nucleatum is its ability to form biofilms and adhere to the host environment. The genome encodes for a large number of autotransporters which are surface adhesins, i.e. proteins embedded in the bacterial membrane but with surface-exposed domains (Sanders et al 2018). Adhesins can bind to specific eukaryotic epithelial cell receptors and thus allow the bacteria to reside in the respective tissues, or can form tightly linked assemblages with neighbouring bacterial cells that lead to bacteria aggregating as tight clusters, providing protection from the host immune system (Umaña et al 2019). Whilst it is of clear relevance and high interest, the surface proteome of Fusobacteria is however still only poorly studied as the organisms are very distantly related to most other known pathogens, are difficult to grow in the lab, and no genetic system has been developed so far. Genome analyses and comparisons to non-pathogenic close relatives across the Phylum (Fusobacteriota) can give us important insights into putative pathogenicity factors that are not present or not enriched in their non-pathogenic relatives. Outer membrane proteins require a specific machinery to ensure they are correctly folded into the outer membrane. In E. coli, this is performed by the BAM complex which folds simple structures like porins (Noinaj et al 2013), and the TAM machinery which is essential to fold some of the autotransporter families and fimbrial systems (Heinz et al 2015). In an ongoing collaboration with A/Prof. Nicholas Noinaj from Purdue University (Indiana, USA), we could show that Fusobacteria only have a BAM-like machinery which however has features of TAM as well, indicating that one machinery performs the functions of both BAM and TAM as known in E. coli (Cottom et al under revision).",
        aim: "There is the opportunity for two students to address one of the questions each: i) Analyse the distribution and sequence diversity of autotransporter in the Fusobacteriota (Phylum), including F. nucleatum but importantly also closely related non-pathogenic members of this phylum, disentangling acquisition events vs lineage-specific duplications. ii) Understand what types of surface proteins (porins, autotransporters, inverse autotransporter, fimbriae, secretion systems) are present in which members of the Fusobacteriota, including classical TAM substrates in Escherichia coli.",

        outline: "The human body is packed with blood vessels. Some estimates even suggest that if you could line up all the blood vessels in a human body, then that line would stretch around the circumference of the world twice. Together, the heart and our blood vessels are known as the cardiovascular system, and its main function is to transport oxygen, nutrients, waste products and hormones around the body. But whilst it is the heart that pumps blood around the body, it is our blood vessels that control exactly where that blood goes. Healthy blood vessels can do this because the walls or blood vessels are able to constrict and relax to increase/decrease blood vessel diameter. However, in many human diseases, this blood flow control fails. Control of blood vessel diameter mainly results from the interaction of two different cell types in the blood vessel wall – smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. It is smooth muscle cells that contract and relax to alter blood vessel diameter. And endothelial cells control this process by releasing vasoactive factors. But the precise mechanisms that allow endothelial cells to direct smooth muscle contaction are not known. In particular, it is unclear what ion channels and plasma membrane receptors are used by either endothelial cells or smooth muscle cells to control blood flow. In this project, you will use publicly available single-cell gene profiling data (e.g., Tabula Muris [1], Tabula Muris Senis [2], EndoDB [3], Betzholtz Database [4]) to define the molecular basis of endothelial or smooth muscle cell function in health and disease. Additionally, you will conduct functional tests on isolated blood vessels to assess the impact of these mechanisms in blood flow control. Understanding these molecular signatures will lay the foundation for identifying new therapeutic targets to treat blood vessel dysfunction in several non-communicable diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes. Alzheimer’s disease).",

        outline: "The most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug is metformin. It has been in use in the UK since 1958 and in the United States since 1995. One mechanism by which metformin works is by activating AMPK, an enzyme inside cells that lowers blood sugar by promoting energy utilization. Activating AMPK has broad-ranging effects that extend far beyond blood sugar control. Studies show that boosting AMPK activity can prevent—and even reverse—the life-shortening effects of aging, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Metformin can block or diminish many of the fundamental factors that accelerate aging. These include protecting against DNA damage glycation, poor mitochondrial function, and chronic inflammation. Metformin has been shown to facilitate DNA repair, which is critical for cancer prevention. Metformin has also been shown to increase the production of known longevity-promoting signalling molecules in cells, such as mTOR and AMPK—all of which reduce fat and sugar storage and increase youthful functioning at the cellular level. Studies have shown that by activating AMPK, metformin specifically impacts lifespan. For example, roundworms treated with metformin have higher AMPK activity and live about 20% longer than untreated control animals. Mice treated with metformin have been found to live nearly 6% longer than controls. And most impressively, diabetics taking metformin were shown to live 15% longer than healthy individuals without diabetes! AMPK activity declines with age, making us more vulnerable to many of the diseases associated with aging. Fortunately, a wealth of recent studies show that by activating AMPK, metformin plays a major role in preventing age-related disorders including cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and neurocognitive decline. By combatting many of the underlying causes of aging—and by activating AMPK—can metformin can be considered a broad-spectrum anti-aging drug?",

In addition, as the ageing population increases, the financial and societal burden of these disorders will also continue to rise. Disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease are incurable, and only a limited number of treatments are available which can manage the symptoms or slow disease progression [2]. Previously, drugs aimed at targeting toxic proteins in the brain which are implicated in these diseases have often failed at the clinical trial stage [3], therefore different therapeutic strategies must be considered in the future. Interestingly, recent links have been made between the gut microbiome, and the development of such neurodegenerative disorders [4,5]. This finding presents a new potential therapeutic avenue for treating these complex and intractable diseases.
