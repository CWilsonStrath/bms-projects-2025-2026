Specifically these projects aim to conduct the following steps: 1) Design and implement a door opening sensor using the BBC microbit. 2) Validate the door open sensor and use it in a lab situation to collect data from multiple cold storage units. 3) Design and implement a temperature sensor using the BBC microbit for monitoring both internal and external temperatures. 4) Validate the temperature sensors and deploy them across selected cold storage units. 5) Establish protocols for analyzing log data to quantify usage patterns and energy efficiency. 6) Enhance user experience by providing relevant feedback to laboratory staff regarding fridge/freezer performance. 7) Explore the feasibility of integrating an Internet of Things (IoT) approach for remote data monitoring and visualization.",
        outline: "Biomedical and healthcare laboratories contribute significantly to global carbon emissions due to their reliance on single-use chemicals, disposable plasticware, and high-energy equipment. It is estimated that biomedical labs generate approximately 2% of the world’s plastic waste (1), and a single laboratory fume hood can consume as much energy as three to four residential homes (2). Implementing sustainability strategies in biomedical settings remains challenging. Compared to fields like chemistry and engineering, there is limited peer-reviewed literature on biomedical sustainability (unpublished data). Existing articles are often opinion-based, review papers, or grey literature (3). Additionally, concerns about greenwashing—where companies make misleading sustainability claims (normally a low carbon footprint under unrealistic operating conditions) —further complicate efforts (4). In response to these challenges, institutions are investing in energy-efficient equipment and the University of Strathclyde is replacing older cold storage units with modern, low-energy models. However, the effectiveness of these upgrades depends on various factors, including usage patterns and environmental conditions (5). While plug-in power monitors can track energy consumption, understanding how often cold storage units are accessed (e.g., door openings) is equally important. This project aims to design and build electronic sensors to collect usage data, thereby enhancing the insights gained from existing power monitoring initiatives. The sensors will be developed using the BBC microbit platform (6). Students with programming experience may use Python, while those new to coding can use Microsoft MakeCode (7)—a visual, block-based programming language suitable for beginners. Any labwork associated with these projects will be done on Tuesday afternoons during semester 1.

        outline: "Since their discovery bacterio(phages) and the systems bacteria use to defend against them have contributed significantly to our understanding of basic molecular biology. Understanding the basic biology of these systems, such as restriction modification (RM) and CRISPR-Cas, has allowed the development of tools that are now indispensable to the fields of biotechnology and synthetic biology. The characterisation and understanding of bacterial defence systems are not only vital to our understanding of bacteria-phage co-evolution but also have the potential to both provide new methods of controlling phage infections in biotechnological and agricultural settings and to produce novel molecular biological tools. Bacterial defence systems are mechanistically diverse but follow an established pattern: a cell is infected; a defence mechanism prevents phage replication; and the cell survives to reproduce, or in dying prevents amplification of phage that could then infect other cells. However, members of the multicellular bacterial genus Streptomyces carry a number of viral defence systems that are currently unclassified. This project will use known bacteriophages and isolate new bacteriophages from the environment to understand newly identified phage defence systems respond to phage infection, and ultimately prevents phage replication.",

There is an urgent need to discover novel antimicrobial drugs to combat the antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) crisis. Streptomyces bacteria produce around 60% of our clinically relevant antimicrobial drugs, and these are encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) in the genomes of producing organisms. Typically, one or two molecules are produced under normal laboratory conditions by Streptomyces, yet genome sequencing has revealed a capacity to produce 20-30 NPs by these strains from so-called silent BGC (sBGC), that are normally inactive under laboratory conditions. Developing methods access these resource is essential. We have shown that disruption of the mtrAB locus leads to increased/activated antibiotic production. We will explore methods to disrupt this locus in a novel Streptomyces strain. Sequencing data indicates this organism has 45 BGC that could potentially be activated.",

These studies will be conducted under cholesterol-enriched conditions to mimic the brain’s cholesterol-rich microenvironment, with the ultimate goal of enhancing the cytotoxic efficacy of cholesterol-targeting therapies and overcoming tumour resistance mechanisms.",
        outline: "Glioblastoma (GBM) displays a marked dependence on cholesterol to sustain its rapid proliferation. However, the brain microenvironment is inherently rich in cholesterol, allowing tumour cells to buffer intracellular fluctuations and maintain growth. Our preliminary data show that inhibiting terminal enzymes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway induces significant cytotoxicity in GBM cells. Notably, this effect is fully reversed and rescued by cholesterol supplementation, indicating that tumour cells can readily compensate for the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis through enhanced cholesterol uptake mechanisms. These findings suggest that targeting cholesterol synthesis alone is insufficient in a cholesterol-rich setting like the brain, where GBM cells can evade cytotoxic effects by activating alternative uptake pathways. To overcome this metabolic plasticity, this project proposes a dual strategy that combines inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis with blockade of cholesterol uptake. In this project, you will investigate pharmacological combinations of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors with uptake blockade in preclinical glioblastoma in vitro models. This approach is designed to disrupt GBM’s adaptive reliance on cholesterol, preserving the cytotoxic effects of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors within the lipoprotein-rich brain microenvironment, and counteracting resistance mechanisms driven by increased cholesterol uptake.",

        outline: "Sleep is conserved in the animal kingdom. Sleep abnormalities are associated with a wide range of brain disorders, but also with cancer and diabetes. But how is sleep regulated or dysregulated? Although various brain regions are involved in sleep, we know little about how distributed neural and non-neural circuits control sleep in concert. To address this fundamental issue, it requires a novel technology to monitor brain-wide dynamics of neuronal and non-neuronal ensembles across sleep-wake cycles. We are developing such a technology, called multi-fibre array-based photometry. This technology aims to monitor cell-type-specific calcium dynamics across multiple regions and sleep-wake cycles by expressing genetically encoded sensors and implanting a multi-fibre array in the mouse brain. In this project, a student will participate in the development of this cutting-edge technology. The student will learn how to fabricate a multi-fibre array and characterize it optically. Although the student will not be able to conduct actual animal procedures due to legal requirements, the student will have an opportunity to observe the procedures. By processing videos that capture cell-type-specific calcium signals in vivo, the student will write his/her dissertation.",

        outline: "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting over 50 million people worldwide. Although novel immunotherapies can delay disease progression by 6 months, their efficacy is limited to only mild forms of the disease. Thus, different therapeutic interventions are urgently needed. Amyloid pathology has long been recognized as a hallmark of AD. Various mouse models have been developed to mimic amyloid pathology. However, traditional models, such as APP/PS1 and 5xFAD mice, rely on artificial overexpression of mutated genes related to amyloid genesis. To overcome this fundamental limitation in traditional models, knock-in models have been developed. The APPNL-G-F mouse line has recently gained popularity. However, this mouse model remains incompletely characterised when and where amyloid pathology and inflammation occur in the brain. In this project, we will comprehensively characterize amyloid pathology and associated microglial responses across the brain. By performing fluorescent immunostaining, we will determine when and where pathology appears in APPNL-G-F mice. The outcome of this project informs future studies to develop a novel intervention strategy.",

        outline: "Sleep requires for survival. Sleep is also essential for memory consolidation. Although sleep is classified into non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep, we know little about how these two distinct sleep-stages contribute to memory consolidation. We recently discovered that two distal brain regions, the hippocampus and pons, functionally interact with each other during sleep and their interactions change by sleep stages. More specifically, by monitoring sleep-related neuronal activity in these two regions, we found that fast brain waves in the hippocampus precede pontine waves, called P-waves, during NREM sleep, whereas hippocampal neural activity follows P-waves during REM sleep. Thus, the directionality of their interactions reverses depending on sleep stages. Since the hippocampus plays a critical role in memory consolidation during sleep, these results imply distinct functional roles of the pons-hippocampus interaction in memory consolidation. In this project, by combining optogenetic, electrophysiological and behavioural approaches in transgenic mice, we will examine if the manipulation of P-waves can facilitate or disrupt memory consolidation depending on how manipulations are introduced. Although a student will not be able to conduct actual animal procedures due to legal requirements, the student will have an opportunity to observe the procedures and analyze real in vivo data to write a dissertation.",

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms remain elusive and there is an urgent need to better understand how anti-angiogenic drugs cause hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases. This is especially important because VEGFi are increasingly being used in combination with other anti-cancer drugs, such as immunotherapies (immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)), other TKIs, and poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, which may themselves induce cardiovascular injury.",

To accurately model these interactions, advanced three-dimensional (3D) in vitro systems are essential for recapitulating the spatial architecture, cellular heterogeneity, and extracellular matrix composition of patient-derived tumours, thereby enabling more physiologically relevant assessment of drug efficacy and therapeutic response (1). Histological processing and analysis are powerful techniques to assess 3D spheroid responses to drug treatment, but in reality, these methods can be laborious, expensive and complex to set up as a routine technique. A recently published paper outlines a simplified low-cost methodology to establish, histologically process and analyse 3D tumour spheroid arrays (2).

Recent research has highlighted that there may be potential in developing therapies that are targeted to specific cell types of the vasculature or heart using novel types of delivery vehicles such as nanoparticles. Cell-based targeting could potentially interfere directly with atherosclerosis progression and/or development of fibrosis however, this relies on highly selective cell markers as targets for therapeutic intervention.",

        outline: "Arthritis of the hip continues to be a leading cause of chronic pain for patients across the UK and current therapy for advanced cases comprises hip replacement. Although technology has improved over the years in terms of the design of hip prostheses, there continue to be major issues associated with the health and overall outlook for patients receiving artificial hips. There is now very strong evidence supporting a link between metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacements (where metals such as cobalt and chromium are used in the artificial joint bearings) and development of heart disease. Over time, cobalt levels rise in the bloodstream of patients with MoM hip replacements and the metal accumulates in various organs of the body. Levels accumulating in the heart can be particularly high. Previous work by our group using rats has shown that cobalt can cause impaired contractile activity of rat hearts. The cellular mechanisms underlying this cobalt-mediated contractile dysfunction may manifest at the level of both contractile and non-contractile cells of the heart. Our work to date has focused on a rat model and we have limited understanding of the effects of cobalt in human cardiac cells. Cardiac fibroblasts are non-contractile cells responsible for providing structural support to the heart via the extracellular matrix and they interact closely with the contractile cardiac myocytes.",

This is even more pertinent for patients who may already exhibit signs of compromised cardiovascular function prior to receiving anti-cancer therapy. Agents such as anthracyclines and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are known to cause compromised cardiac function over time and in some cases, can lead to heart failure.

[data analysis] -Can we create a bacterial growth assay that tests combinations of antibiotics or TCMs to see if their potency is related to the direction of action on global gene expression mechanism? Obviously, this partly assumes that bacteria have a system of nucleotide supply and demand that is equivalent to that found in the animals. [laboratory experimentation]",
        outline: "I recently published a paper that describes a novel mechanism of gene expression control that doesn't act through individual gene promoters but acts instead on the capacity of the cell to synthesise mRNAs from constituent nucleotides. You can imagine that, if a particular nucleotide is in short supply, then mRNA transcripts more enriched in that nucleotide will be harder to synthesise and therefore expressed at a lower level. So, this form of gene expression regulation acts by combining supply (of nucleotides) and demand (of each mRNA and its composition) to produce a global change in expression profile. I have observed that common diseases, drugs, viral infections, the menstrual cycle, circadian rhythms, and environmental pollutants all seem to perturb global expression through this mechanism. This suggests that these phenomena alter nucleotide levels in cells. Why? It seems that some genes have evolved extreme sequence compositions which make them more likely to be regulated by this process - this might be a way to hard-wire large-scale cellular transcriptional responses to physiological changes that involve changes in nucleotide availability. In terms of drugs and environmental pollutants, approximately 20% of them perturb global gene expression and they can do this in one of two directions (think of a children’s see-saw). Antibiotics are a good example of medications that that can do this, and there are examples of these drugs that ‘push’ the see-saw in either direction. For example, methicillin and tetracycline act in different directions. One class of potential medications, not yet been examined, that might also affect this mechanism are the ‘herbal remedies’, also known as ‘natural products’, also known in China as components of ‘Traditional Chinese Medicine: TCM’.",

This is achieved by regulated delivery of intracellular glucose transporter (GLUT4)-containing vesicles to the plasma membrane where they dock and fuse, resulting in increased cell surface GLUT4 levels. Recent work identified a potential further regulatory step, in which insulin increases the dispersal of GLUT4 in the plasma membrane away from the sites of vesicle fusion. EFR3 is a scaffold protein that facilitates localisation of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIIalpha to the cell surface [2-4]. We have found that knockdown of EFR3 or phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIIalpha impairs insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocytes [1]. Using direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy, we also show that EFR3 knockdown impairs insulin stimulated GLUT4 dispersal in the plasma membrane. We proposed that EFR3 plays a previously unidentified role in controlling insulin-stimulated glucose transport by facilitating dispersal of GLUT4 within the plasma membrane [1].",

While current management approaches are efficacious, limitations exist particularly in terms of costs for developing nations. Consequently, research is increasingly examining the role of traditional therapies for anti-diabetic treatments [11, 12]. More than 800 plant species have been suggested to have an anti-diabetic potential [11]. For example, the roots of Zingiber officinale (ginger) lowered serum glucose levels in ginger-treated rat models of diabetes compared with the control animal models and has some efficacy in human studies [13-16]. Traditional plant-based remedies are readily accessible to most remote and poor areas in Africa, making them of particular interest [11, 12]. Extracts of Parinari curatellifolia have been used as a traditional medicine in Sub-Saharan Africa for the management of various ailments like cancer, diabetes, pneumonia, and inflammatory conditions [17]. Phytochemical screening of this plant indicated that it contained compounds including polyphenol, vitamin C and other secondary metabolites, such as alkaloid, anthraquinones, and glycosides which could contribute to its antioxidant properties [17-19]. Thus, this plant may exert an antidiabetic activity through its antioxidant properties as there is a strong link between oxidative stress and type-2 diabetes.",

To work effectively, it relies on a delicate balance between different organs, cells, and signalling molecules. One important group of cells involved in maintaining this balance is regulatory B cells (Bregs). These cells help control immune responses and prevent excessive inflammation that could harm the body. Recent studies have shown that there are several types of regulatory B cells, each with unique characteristics and functions, including but not limited to IL-10-producing Bregs, granzyme B-expressing Bregs, and Bregs characterized by specific surface markers such as CD1d and CD5. However, it is still unclear what signals cause B cells to become these different subtypes, and whether each subtype plays a distinct role in the immune system. This project will explore: • What signals drive the differentiation of B cells into various regulatory subtypes. • How the functions of these subtypes differ, especially in terms of controlling immune responses and supporting tissue repair. By investigating these questions, the project aims to improve our understanding of how regulatory B cells contribute to immune balance. This knowledge could eventually help in designing better treatments for autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation, and other immune-related conditions.",

These vessels are crucial for guiding immune cells to the correct location, where they await activation in response to infection, disease, or other immune challenges. However, during tumour progression, lymph nodes undergo reprogramming facilitating immune evasion. One observed effect is the disruption in B cell trafficking to the follicles. A leading hypothesis suggests that these lymph nodes become enriched with extracellular matrix components, which may hinder immune cell movement.

        outline: "Cytokine signalling is a fundamental component of the immune response, orchestrating the recruitment and activation of immune cells and shaping the nature of the response to pathogens or disease. Among these cytokines, Interleukin-19 (IL-19) has emerged as a molecule of interest due to its complex and context-dependent roles in immunity. IL-19 is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family and is primarily produced by monocytes, macrophages, and to a lesser extent, B cells. IL-19 has been described as immunosuppressive and tumour-promoting, particularly in glioblastoma and other cancers, where it contributes to immune evasion by promoting M2-like macrophage polarization and dampening T cell activation. Despite its recognized role in modulating macrophage and T cell responses, the direct effects of IL-19 on B cells remain poorly understood. Some evidence suggests that IL-19 promotes anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, such as IL-10, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This project aims to characterize the effects of IL-19 on B cell function, focusing on its influence on B cell activation, cytokine production, and antibody secretion. Understanding how IL-19 modulates B cell responses could provide new insights into its role in tumour-associated immune regulation.",

        outline: "Long-term resilience of neurons, as well as glia and brain vascular cells, is essential for them to endure stressors such as ischaemia, proteinopathies that can lead to neurodegeneration and the normal aging process. Neurons are post-mitotic, energetically highly demanding, and are dependent upon support provided by astrocytes and local metabolic supply from the brain’s vascular network. Mitochondria within each of these cell types are essential for efficient metabolic supply and flexibility, as well as playing roles in calcium homeostasis and oxidative balance. Mitochondrial overload during stressful situations can, however, actually contribute to decline as damaged mitochondria produce excessive reactive oxygen species, consume ATP and release their calcium stores to feed-forward decline to neighbouring mitochondria, contributing to cell death processes. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-Gamma Coactivator 1-Alpha (PGC-1?) is a transcriptional co-activator and master regulator of energy metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1? can be stimulated by modulating energy-sensing pathways, various pharmacological agents and potentially by metabolite alterations. There is growing evidence that stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis via increased PGC-1? can protect in a number of cellular models. This protection may come from neurons themselves, or from supporting neural cells – for example increasing mitochondrial biogenesis specifically in astrocytes alone protects and reverses motor-neuron decline in a model of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Enhancing PGC-1? activity is thus of great therapeutic potential in diverse neurological (and other) disorders.",

        outline: "Blockage of blood vessels within the brain results in local deprivation of the oxygen and metabolites that are essential for cell function and survival. Prolonged ischaemia causes necrosis in the most affected regions, with a surrounding penumbra that can reperfuse but is susceptible to apoptosis – particularly of neurons that are largely post-mitotic and thus irreplaceable. At the same time, there can be a shift in astrocytes towards a reactive phenotype and impairment or cell death in the endothelial cells of brain capillaries. The extent of neurological deficit caused is dependent upon the size of the damaged region (as well as CNS location), thus interventions that minimise delayed neurodegeneration post-ischaemia have much clinical potential. Oxidative stress during post-ischaemia reperfusion is thought to be one driver of delayed neural cell death. This project will quantify the ability of antioxidants to protect astrocytes, brain endothelial cells and/or neurons, and their mitochondria during or after acute periods of ischaemia. We will compare the efficiency of antioxidants targeted specifically to mitochondria, as well as general antioxidants.",

        outline: "Given their high energy demands and post-mitotic nature, neurons are particularly susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction. Emerging evidence suggests that spontaneous intercellular mitochondrial transfer between neurons and glial cells, particularly astrocytes and microglia, might serve as a compensatory response to restore mitochondrial homeostasis in acute conditions such as stroke, but also in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Tunnelling nanotubes are F-actin-based membranous channels that connect cell cytoplasm directly, enabling the intercellular transfer of diverse cellular components, including mitochondria. Despite increasing evidence for the role of tunnelling nanotubes in mitochondrial transfer, direct visualisation remains limited, and their physiological regulation or functional outcomes remain unclear.",

One of the potential effects of the nutrient and oxygen deprivation that occurs during cerebral ischaemia is an adaptational change in the morphology of mitochondria.

This project will evaluate how effectively national HPV materials communicate gender inclusive messages and identify specific improvements. What you will do: You will quantify how well official materials communicate these points by coding a corpus of NHS leaflets, school consent packs, and website pages against a structured checklist. You will measure how often and how explicitly male cancers and boys eligibility are mentioned, how easy these facts are to find on the page and whether language meets plain English standards using Flesch Kincaid and accessibility checks. You will generate summary tables and figures, rank strengths and gaps and then design the next step by preparing a short survey or focus group protocol to test recall and understanding of the priority messages, including consent or assent forms and an ethics application pack. Due to the project timeline, primary data collection is not expected this year. Impact: You will produce concrete, evidence based recommendations to redesign HPV information so it is clearer, more gender inclusive and equitable across SIMD groups, and you will deliver a ready to launch study for the next phase.

It will explore how blocking CTLA-4 enhances early T cell priming in lymphoid organs, while PD-1/PD-L1 blockade restores effector T cell function within the tumour microenvironment. Emergent targets such as LAG-3, TIM-3, and TIGIT, which modulate immune cell exhaustion, regulatory T cell activity, and antigen-presenting cell interactions, will also be analysed. The project will also address immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which arise from systemic immune activation. These include autoimmune-like responses affecting the skin, gut, endocrine organs, and lungs, and are linked to dysregulated T cell responses and loss of peripheral tolerance.",

Ammonium exchange is mediated by the ubiquitous ammonium transporter/methylammonium permease/Rhesus (Amt/Mep/Rh) protein family. The major role of bacterial, fungal, and plant Amt/Mep proteins is to scavenge ammonium for biosynthetic assimilation, whereas mammals are thought to express Rh proteins to detoxify erythrocytes, kidney, and liver cells. Members of the Amt/Mep/Rh family have also been found to be important drivers of the virulence of infectious fungi. In humans, Rh mutations are linked to pathologies that include inherited hemolytic anemia, stomatocytosis, and early-onset depressive disorder. Despite this key general and biomedical importance, so far, no consensus on the pathway and mechanism of ammonium transport by the Amt/Mep/Rh family has been reached",

Current standard treatments, including surgery, radiation and temozolomide, primarily work by inducing DNA damage to block cell division and trigger cell death. However, GBM cells often activate additional survival pathways that support tumour growth and drive resistance to this therapy. Identifying novel glioblastoma-specific vulnerabilities could open new avenues for intervention and significantly improve patient outcomes. This project aims to uncover molecular alterations that are unique to glioblastoma. By leveraging public resources such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gliovis, we will systematically analyse gene expression changes, mutations, protein expression levels, and other molecular signatures in GBM compared with normal brain tissue.

None of this is good for the cancer patient. One approach to circumvent this problem is to repurpose existing non-cancer or cancer drugs against cancers to provide new or novel therapies or new formulation of existing therapies which could reduce costs, enhance tumour specificity, reduce toxicity or rapidly accelerate the introduction of new therapies into clinical practice. This is particularly relevant for paediatric and hard to treat cancers such as pancreatic cancer, brain tumours, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and triple negative breast cancer and cancers where there is currently an unmet need for effective less toxic cancer drugs. Furthermore often the primary cancer is not the therapeutic issue, but the metastatic and therapy resistant cancer that returns. New therapies are therefore needed for the treatment of hard to treat and therapy resistant cancer. We therefore urgently require new approaches to develop more effective and less toxic treatments for cancer patients where there is poor survival and limited treatment options. Our laboratory has been assessing new combination therapies using repurposed drugs and radiotherapy and have identified combination therapies that have promise in the treatment of these hard to treat cancers.",

        outline: "Despite the considerable resources being invested into the discovery of new cancer drugs, novel therapies suffer from high failure rates, high cost, limited efficacy and a lengthy timeline before they become clinically available. None of this is good for the cancer patient. Often cancer cells display resistance to chemotherapy drugs and personalised medicine due to inherent resistance mechanism- this leads to cancers initially appearing to respond to treatments only to recur months later as therapy resistant. Radiotherapy is used in the treatment of around 50% of cancer patients, is highly effective at killing cancer cells and there are fewer resistance mechanism cancer cells can deploy to escape the toxic effects of radiation. Despite these features, there has been little investment and research in improving the use of radiotherapy in cancer patients by optimising is tumour killing potential and equally as important reducing its toxic effects. If these challenges can be overcome, radiotherapy could be utilised safely and effectively in more cancer patients, including very young children and could begin to elicit cures and reduce therapy resistance. Our group has been researching how to better use radiotherapy alone and in combination with other drugs and this work has already led to translation of some therapies into the clinic. We hypothesise that understanding the effects of radiotherapy on normal and tumour cells could lead to further breakthroughs for patients with cancer.",

        aim: "To apply evolutionary and bioinformatic analyses to pathogen virulence proteins, to identify candidate functional and/or druggable sites.",
        outline: "Infectious diseases caused by microbial pathogens have, until the advent of antibiotic treatment in the 20th Century, been the most common cause of death in humans throughout history (Balloux & van Dorp, 2017 https://doi.org/10.1186/s12915-017-0433-z). Microbial pathogens also continue to be the major biotic threat to global crop production (Almeida et al., 2019 https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.00214; Wang et al., 2022 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41579-022-00710-3). Interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts - both attack and defence - can be mediated by small (e.g. secondary metabolites) and large (e.g. proteins) molecules (Teixeira et al., 2019 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2019.08.003; Olive & Sassetti, 2016 https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2016.12). Genome sequencing produces a very large number of microbial genome sequences, enabling the identification and discovery of many candidate genes whose protein products are expected to mediate interactions between microbial pathogens and their hosts (Davey & Valdivia, 2019 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2020.01.007; Urban et al., 2022 https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkab1037). This allows for extensive and wide-ranging evolutionary studies of proteins involved in pathogenicity. However, understanding the relationship of sequence variation to protein function requires knowledge of 3D protein structure, but experimental structure determination has not kept up the same rate as sequencing approaches. AlphaFold and its variants promise great advances in protein structure prediction. They produce, in many cases, candidate structures that are accurate at atomic level to experimentally-derived structures (Jumper et al., 2021 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03819-2). In conjunction with the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the AlphaFoldDB server provides predicted structures for almost all proteins in UniProt (https://www.alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/). This enables the extension of many bioinformatic approaches for investigating relationships between evolution, sequence, and function biologically-important molecules that do not have an experimentally-solved 3D structure, with groundbreaking implications for drug targeting, and understanding fundamental host-pathogen interactions. In this project each students will work with a different virulence-related protein from an important pathogen species. They will use an experimental or AlphaFold-predicted structure for their protein to help interpret its evolutionary history and suggest candidate functional and/or druggable sites. Approaches that might be taken during the course of the project include: - sequence-based search and enumeration of known homologues/orthologues - comparison of structural predictions for related proteins, and structural identification of remote homologues - evolutionary analysis/phylogenetic reconstruction of pathogen proteins - prediction of conserved functional sites by mapping sequence variation onto predicted structure - identification of coevolving sites",

        outline: "Tumorigenesis is driven by recurrent driver alterations, single-nucleotide variants, copy-number changes, and gene fusions, that rewire signalling pathways (e.g., MAPK/ERK, PI3K/AKT, DNA repair). Targeted agents exploit oncogene addiction or pathway dependency and are often authorised first within one tumour type before tumour-agnostic expansion to others sharing the same alteration (e.g., KRAS G12C, IDH1/2, BRAF V600E, NTRK fusions). Feasibility for such expansion depends on robust estimates of alteration prevalence, co-mutation landscapes (which modulate response and resistance) and the prognostic/predictive association of the biomarker with outcomes. Public cancer genomics resources (patient cohorts and clinical annotations) enable this evidence-building prior to trials. In this project you will select a target–tumour pair (for example, KRAS G12C in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, IDH1 in glioma, FGFR2 in cholangiocarcinoma) and integrate genomic and clinical data to generate a decision-grade assessment of therapeutic viability.",

        outline: "The silent pandemic of antibiotic resistance was responsible for 1.27 million deaths in 2019. Most of these deaths, 0.9 million, were caused by the six leading bacterial pathogens associated with antibiotic resistant infections; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. This project is focused on P. aeruginosa a major cause of hospital acquired infections such as ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), bacteremia and catheter-associated urinary tract infections. A major and rapidly growing problem in treating P. aeruginosa infection is antibiotic resistance. Clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa with resistance to nearly all available antibiotics are prevalent worldwide and between 18 and 25% of clinical isolates are multidrug resistant, showing resistance to three or more frontline antibiotics. An alternative strategy for antibiotic discovery is to utilize the narrow spectrum antibiotics used by bacteria for intraspecies competition. In Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae these take the form of related high molecular weight protein antibiotics (bacteriocins), termed pyocins, colicins and klebicins, respectively. The use of bacteriocins will, in contrast to the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, allow specific pathogens to be targeted leaving the wider microbial community intact. The devastating impact of conventional antibiotics on the structure, composition and functionality of human microbiomes is now recognised with increased antibiotic use in early life associated with an increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases such as IBD and asthma in later life. The aim of this project is to engineer novel pyocins with a broad activity against P. aeruginosa clinical isolates including antibiotic resistant isolates.",

This is due largely to a lack of understanding of the cellular mechanisms that underlie the development and maintenance of chronic pain. In recent years, however, a number of receptors (inc. ATP-activated P2X, capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1) and ion channels (inc. Nav, Cav) have been identified in pain-sensing nerves and associated cells that appear to contribute to chronic pain. Thus these signalling components have been proposed as potential targets for the development of novel analgesics that can provide effective management of chronic pain. Subsequently, the pharmaceutical industry has generated an increasing number of drugs that are currently undergoing clinical trials.",

        outline: "Serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a significant factor contributing to drug attrition during pharmaceutical development and after market approval. Establishing the safety profile of a new drug is a complex process that continues long after it reaches the market, often requiring several years of real-world use before safety can be fully assessed. Thus, authorities such as the FDA in the USA and MHRA in the UK continually monitor and report on ADRs. Meta-analysis has become a widely used method for identifying adverse effects of drugs and vaccines. In many ways, meta-analysis is particularly well-suited for this purpose. Efficacy studies typically lack the size necessary to accurately assess risks that emerge when a medication is broadly administered. Meta-analysis, with its statistical efficiency in combining data from multiple studies, offers a natural solution for uncovering these potential risks. In this project, you will identify a drug which has had recent concerns raised regarding its safety. You will then formulate your own research question. For example: “Is there a link between brolucizumab use and serious adverse ocular effects?”. You will extract data from published clinical trials and carry out a meta-analysis to answer your research question.",

        outline: "Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that infect and kill bacteria. Unlike broad-spectrum antibiotics, phages are highly specific, targeting only their bacterial hosts and leaving beneficial microbes unharmed. This precision makes them attractive for phage therapy [1], especially as resistance to conventional antibiotics escalates. Enterococcus spp. are Gram positive bacteria commonly found as part of the healthy gut flora in humans and animals. In recent decades, however, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium have emerged as important opportunistic pathogens [2]. These organisms cause a range of diseases, including urinary tract, wound and bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. Furthermore, both organisms display increasing rates of intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance (including to drugs of last resort) rendering treatment of invasive infections challenging. These features make enterococcal infections prime targets for phage therapy. Phage therapy development depends on identifying phages that efficiently infect target bacteria. Plaque assays are integral to this process as they allow visualisation of areas of lysis on a lawn of target bacteria. For Enterococcus phages, success requires carefully balancing bacterial growth (to form an even lawn) with optimal infection conditions. Divalent cations, such as calcium (Ca²?) and magnesium (Mg²?), are known to enhance phage adsorption and infection efficiency in various systems [3]. However, the most effective cations for promoting phage infection in Enterococcus spp. remain unclear, with no consensus met across existing studies.",

These organisms cause a range of diseases, including urinary tract, wound and bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. Furthermore, they display increasing rates of intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance - including to drugs of last resort - rendering treatment of invasive infections challenging. Phage therapy, which involves using bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to selectively kill pathogenic bacteria, is a promising strategy for treating antibiotic-resistant infections [2]. However, its effectiveness can be influenced by prophages, which are dormant phages integrated into the genomes of the target bacteria. While the number of prophages carried by enterococcal strains varies, they are often integrated at conserved genomic sites. These integration sites are determined by the sequence of the phage-encoded integrase enzyme, which tends to be conserved among prophages that localise to the same genomic regions. In other organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, this sequence conservation has been exploited to develop PCR-based methods for identifying both the number and location of prophages in clinical isolates without a requirement for whole genome sequencing [3]. Since enterococcal prophages have similar modular structures to S. aureus and are found at conserved regions within the bacterial chromosome, this project will investigate development of a similar assay for prophage screening in E. faecalis.",

        outline: "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancer are among the leading causes of global mortality. The complex pathomechanisms of these diseases are multifactorial and are influenced by various genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. A critical contributor to both conditions is hypoxia, defined as inadequate oxygen availability, which impacts multiple biological processes associated with disease progression. Hypoxia is known to drive hyperproliferative responses and plays a pivotal role triggering a cascade of cellular responses, primarily through the activation of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). Hypoxia influences proliferative vascular signalling, contributing to detrimental vascular remodelling and inflammation. Furthermore, exosomes (small vesicles released from cells) have emerged as key mediators of hypoxic signalling, serving as biomarkers of disease and active communicators in the tumour microenvironment. Understanding these hypoxic mechanisms will help evaluate therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating CVD and cancer complications.",

        outline: "Enterococci are Gram-positive bacteria that form part of the normal gut microbiota in humans and animals. However, they are also important opportunistic pathogens, increasingly associated with hospital-acquired infections such as urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections [1]. These infections are becoming more difficult to treat due to the growing prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Enterococcus species, including resistance to last-resort antibiotics like vancomycin. This growing threat makes it critical to better understand the mechanisms that drive both enterococcal virulence and the spread of resistance. One major driver of these traits is plasmids [2]. Plasmids are episomal segments of DNA that frequently carry virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes. Importantly, plasmids can be transferred between bacteria through Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT), enabling even non-pathogenic strains to acquire traits that make them more dangerous in clinical settings. In this project, you will work with public genome databases and user-friendly, web-based tools such as ABRicate, VirProfile2, CARD, oriT Finder and CONJscan, to characterise key features of plasmids carried by the two species of Enterococcus most frequently associated with invasive disease: Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. The project seeks to further our understanding of the mechanisms of plasmid transfer, antibiotic resistance spread, and plasmid contribution to host-pathogen responses in infections with these organisms, answering pertinent questions such as: (i) Do E. faecalis and E. faecium differ in the frequency and diversity of mobilisable plasmids carrying resistance or virulence genes? (ii) How does the origin of an isolate (e.g. clinical vs. environmental) influence its plasmid content? (iii) How might the distribution of anti-plasmid defence systems (e.g. CRISPR-Cas, Wadjet, type I/II Restriction Modification systems [3]) alter plasmid dynamics in isolates from different species and/or sources? The project is particularly well-suited to microbiology students but can also be tailored to fit the interests of those with an immunology or biochemistry background.",

The project will look to provide molecular level insights into the structures, interactions, and activation mechanisms of selected pharmacological receptors.",
        outline: "High-resolution structural data for monomeric receptors are abundant, with thousands of entries in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) from X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM. In contrast, structural information on receptor assemblies is limited, as these are often short-lived, dynamic, or membrane-associated and therefore harder to capture experimentally. Yet, many receptor families (including receptor tyrosine kinases, G protein–coupled receptors, and cytokine receptors) are well known to function as dimers or higher-order complexes, where their physical interaction is critical for signalling and regulation. These interfaces likely present valuable therapeutic targets, offering opportunities to disrupt or stabilise specific states with high selectivity. Advances in deep learning approaches may provide new ways to model these complexes and inform future structure-based drug design. Since the publication of the first iteration of AlphaFold in 2020, it has been heralded as a landmark in de novo protein structure prediction. Developed by Google’s DeepMind, AlphaFold comprised an entirely new kind of software, in that it was first and foremost an AI-driven neural network. It was trained using vast quantities of data to make accurate predictions of distances between pairs of residues, and was more powerful than existing methodologies. In mid-2024, DeepMind published the third generation of this software (AF3), which, in addition to further refinement that has made it more accurate, is also believed to accurately predict interactions of proteins, the effects of point mutations, post-translational modifications and, in some cases, make predictions about the nature of ligand binding sites.",

At the same time, closely related strains are frequently found in soil, water, and plant environments, raising questions about how environmental isolates acquire the traits that enable human infection. Understanding the differences between clinical and environmental isolates is critical for identifying the pathways through which harmless environmental bacteria adapt to cause disease. This project will investigate how isolates from clinical and environmental origins differ in their growth dynamics, antimicrobial resistance, and expression of virulence-associated traits such as biofilm formation, iron acquisition, and cytolytic activity. It will also explore how these phenotypes relate to in vivo pathogenic potential. Together, these comparisons will provide insight into the evolutionary and ecological factors that underpin Klebsiella’s transition from environmental survival to clinical threat, and identify phenotypic signatures that could aid in monitoring emerging high-risk strains.",

        outline: "Prostaglandins are well established secondary mediators of inflammation which are derived from arachidonic acid and their synthesis can be inhibited by aspirin-like drugs. However, more recently it has been recognised that prostaglandins, particularly PGE2 can suppress the production of the main inflammatory mediators, specifically tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-?) in a negative-feedback regulation and PGE2 has been shown to be one of the most potent immunoregulatory mediators so far studied [1, 2], with the ability to completely abolish many immune cell activities. In addition to inhibiting cytokine release prostanoids can also suppress the cell pathology induced by TNF-? i.e. preventing cell death [1]. They appear to have cytoprotective properties. There are many different series of prostaglandins in addition to PGE2 such as PGD2 and the more recently discovered PGE2-ethanolamide (from anandamide the ethanolamide derivative of arachidonic acid [3]). The fatty acid-ethanolamides can also be antiproliferative, which is important in the control of cancer cells and have already been shown to control the growth of solid cancers [4]. This raises the question of whether other fatty acid acid-derived lipids that can be synthesised during immune responses, can also regulate cell survival responses and if so the nature/ mechanisms by which they do so.",

        outline: "During inflammation there are a sequence of inflammatory mediators (produced by immune cells) which enter the systemic circulation and are able to affect the whole body. Infectious agents stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1. These in turn result in the production of secondary mediators especially prostaglandins (PGs) such as PGE2. These PGs can limit the extent of inflammation but are also responsible for the end symptoms. The effects of novel PGs such ethanolamide derivatives or 15d-PGJ2 is less clear as is their interaction with the upstream cytokines. This provides potential targets for novel anti-inflammatory therapies based on PG receptors or their pathways. In addition, some chronic immune mechanisms recently described which involve T cell derived cytokines/ mediators may provide some insight into therapeutic targets. It is intended to evaluate evidence which points to novel targets for therapy especially those which alter either acute, or more likely, chronic immune responses involving adaptive immune interactions such as T cells and their cytokines/ signalling. PG pathways could be evaluated in the project but PG-independent mechanisms are also acceptable.",

        outline: "Mosquitoes are more than just annoying insects, they are among the deadliest animals on the planet, responsible for spreading diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika. But mosquitoes themselves are also hosts for their own “insect viruses” and bacterial partners like Wolbachia, which can change how they survive, reproduce, and transmit disease. On top of that, many mosquito populations are evolving resistance to insecticides, making them harder to control. Understanding which species of mosquitoes are present, what infections they carry, and whether they are resistant is crucial for both public health and for developing smarter ways to manage mosquito populations. By the end of this project, you won’t just have pipetted and run gels, you’ll have contributed to a real surveillance study of mosquitoes from Pakistan. The data you generate could help validate computer models of mosquito wingbeats, reveal how widespread helpful or harmful microbes are, and shed light on the growing challenge of insecticide resistance. This is a project where small pieces of data (your PCR bands) feed into a larger story about global health, evolution, and the hidden biology of mosquitoes.",

One modification that has come to prominence over recent years is S-acylation, where fatty acids are added onto cysteine residues in proteins. This modification is mediated by a family of 23 \"ZDHHC\" enzymes and these enzymes have been linked to disorders including cancer, neurodegeneration and diabetes. A major area of research in this field is to develop novel and selective inhibitors against individual ZDHHC enzymes to support research into their cellular functions. Recent work from our group has identified a novel approach to targeting ZDHHC17, an enzyme linked to Huntington's Disease and Type I diabetes. This involves using peptides to block the substrate binding pocket. As this work is at an early stage, we are studying ways to improve the potency of these peptide inhibitors. The aim of the project is to develop plasmids encoding novel forms of these inhibitors and then test the ability of the inhibitors to engage with ZDHHC17 in cells and disrupt the S-acylation activity of the enzyme.",

It induces macrophage differentiation toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype, promoting a regulatory immune response. This results in reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine production and inhibits the activation of effector T cells. Small molecular analogues (SMAs) of ES-62 are synthesized compounds that mimic the immune-modulating effects of ES-62, particularly in modulating macrophage polarization and reducing inflammation. Thus these SMAs are considered potential candidates for therapeutic strategies targeting autoimmune conditions, chronic inflammation, and allergic responses by leveraging the immune-regulatory functions of ES-62 without the need for parasitic infection. Microglial cells are the resident macrophages in the central nervous system (CNS), and play an important role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders including multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease.",

The UK infection rate is projected to increase by 6.2% over the next decade, with Scotland particularly affected. Immunocompromised individuals, such as those with cystic fibrosis, HIV, rheumatoid arthritis, or post-surgery, are especially vulnerable. Currently, there are no standard treatment for NTM infections; patients are treated with multiple antibiotics, which increases the risk of resistance, and the cure rate remains below 50%. Therefore, understanding NTM pathogenesis and identifying new therapeutic targets are urgently needed.

These molecules colour our world and are essential in all living organisms; featured members are the green chlorophyll, the red haem, and the red-orange vitamin B12. Iron-containing haem is the most versatile due to the importance of iron redox chemistry in a range of important biological processes. Specialised enzymes degrade haem to recycle iron, producing a variety of haem ‘skeletons’. These haem skeletons are well characterised in animals; they are responsible for the colour of urine and eggshells but are also involved in protection from oxidative damage, in cell regulation, and disease. Recently, pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Escherichia coli, have been found to possess non-canonical haem-degrading enzymes that produce unusual haem skeletons that either have biological functions or are metabolic wastes. The project will investigate the different protein families of bacterial haem degrading enzymes, hypothesise about the biological functions, discuss and propose the future directions.",

        outline: "The current manufacturing model of medicines relies on mass production of large batches with a limited number of doses. However, this approach overlooks interindividual factors between patients resulting in variations in the therapeutic response and potential inefficacy or toxicity reactions. Reports suggest that 40-70% prescribed medications are ineffective and 1 in 15 hospital admissions are in relation to adverse drug effects resulting from inadequate doses. There is growing need for a more personalised medicine approach taking into account individual needs and complexity of diseases towards developing new pharmaceutical forms. Additive manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing and inkjet printing (IJP) are emerging as alternative methods towards personalised medicines. IJP technology is characterised by high precision in pharmaceutical ink deposition, avoiding contact with the substrate and allowing for accurate control of the printed dose based on the volume ejected through the nozzle. Additionally, IJP offers great flexibility in terms of substrate as formulated inks can be printed onto a wide variety of materials including films, stents, contact lenses, nails. Orodispersible films (ODFs) are ultra-thin, stamp-sized, elegant, portable and patient-centric pharmaceutical dosage forms that do not need water to be ingested. They are particularly useful for paediatric and geriatric patient populations with special needs such as dysphagia, Parkinson’s disease, while they can be used for topical delivery of antimicrobials and anti-inflammatory drugs to dental cavities or oral mucosa for a local application. IJP technology can be an alternatively to currently manufacturing method and allow facile and cost-effective manufacture of these dosage forms. IJP of orodispersible films requires the development of a film substrate with appropriate characteristics for printing and the use of a pharmaceutical ink that contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient.",

Once infected, DFU take months to years to heal, while infection can spread to the bone being only treatable by amputation. Prognosis is grim with 70% of DFU-associated amputations patients being dead within 5 years4. Antimicrobials (orally or via injection) do not accumulate in DFU due to reduced blood supply.

The role of pituitary GnRH receptors in the control of reproductive functions is well established, with emerging roles in hormone-dependent tumours [2], which has led to the development of new ways to target GnRH1R in cancer [3]. This project is part of an ongoing collaboration between Dr Paul Mulheran (Chemical and Process Engineering, Strathclyde), Dr Val Ferro (SIPBS) and the Cunningham laboratory. Recent work in Mulheran’s group has studied the interactions between native GnRH and its cognate receptor, GnRH1R, which is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). GnRH1R has recently been successfully modelled by the research team, revealing a new mechanism for how GnRH activates it and how analogs could replicate this action. Resolution of the structure of the human GnRH1R has revealed an unusual ligand binding mode [4], however new insights gained from the Mulheran lab suggest that alterations in GnRH1R receptor trafficking may be important for its unique receptor pharmacology.",

While there are multiple causes of cardiovascular disease, most develop as a consequence of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is promoted by factors such as oxidation of LDL cholesterol, accumulation of that oxidized fat in arterial walls, and damage to the endothelium, which is the thin layer of cells lining those arterial walls. The most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug metformin is now known to prevent these early steps in atherosclerosis development. Metformin has been in use in the UK since 1958 and in the United States since 1995. One of the key ways it does this is by activating the metabolic regulator AMPK. By activating AMPK, metformin diminishes LDL oxidation and reduces endothelial dysfunction, which slows the development of atherosclerosis. You'll conduct a comprehensive critical analysis of the evidence for metformin's cardiovascular protective effects in non-diabetic populations. You'll systematically evaluate clinical trials, observational studies, and mechanistic research to determine whether metformin should be considered for primary cardiovascular prevention.",

        outline: "The most commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug is metformin. It has been in use in the UK since 1958 and in the United States since 1995. One mechanism by which metformin works is by activating AMPK, an enzyme inside cells that lowers blood sugar by promoting energy utilization. Activating AMPK has broad-ranging effects that extend far beyond blood sugar control. Studies show that boosting AMPK activity can prevent—and even reverse—the life-shortening effects of aging, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Metformin can block or diminish many of the fundamental factors that accelerate aging. These include protecting against DNA damage glycation, poor mitochondrial function, and chronic inflammation. Metformin has been shown to facilitate DNA repair, which is critical for cancer prevention. Metformin has also been shown to increase the production of known longevity-promoting signalling molecules in cells, such as mTOR and AMPK—all of which reduce fat and sugar storage and increase youthful functioning at the cellular level. Studies have shown that by activating AMPK, metformin specifically impacts lifespan. For example, roundworms treated with metformin have higher AMPK activity and live about 20% longer than untreated control animals. Mice treated with metformin have been found to live nearly 6% longer than controls. And most impressively, diabetics taking metformin were shown to live 15% longer than healthy individuals without diabetes! You'll conduct a comprehensive critical analysis of the evidence supporting metformin as a potential anti-aging intervention. By systematically evaluating preclinical studies, clinical trials, and mechanistic research, you'll assess whether the current data justifies considering metformin as the first prescribed anti-aging drug.",

Whilst it is known to be highly variable (Brettell et al. 2025), we however have a very limited understanding of the members of the microbiome and their interactions. Studies focused on isolating bacteria have so far relied on standard growth media, which are selective for fast-growing taxa like Enterobacteriaceae, whilst important members that prefer other growth conditions or are more temperature sensitive will not be captured (Foo et al. 2024; Browne et al. 2016). To address this important gap of knowledge, you will prepare growth media selecting for non-standard growth conditions (low/high pH, salt concentrations, blood agar plates, low oxygen environments, specific media for particular taxa) and isolate bacteria from samples derived from different mosquito species (Culex spp, Aedes spp, Anopheles spp) and life stages (eggs, larvae, pupae, adults) sourced from our collaborators. The bacteria will be identified initially by colony morphology and biochemical characterisation then selected colonies will undergo 16S rRNA gene PCR, which you will then submit to sequencing, and analyse using phylogenetics to identify the taxonomy. Isolates of interest will then be prepared for whole-genome sequencing and to be deposited at the NCTC, the national culture collection, to contribute to the community resource. The project will also involve using R for data analysis to analyse and visualise the microbiology data as well as work with phylogenetic trees.",

Using the Mesolens, we observed intra-colony channels with a diameter of approximately 10 ?m, which emerge as a natural consequence of biofilm growth. These channels have been shown to play a crucial role in nutrient transport throughout the biofilm, but their cell-channel boundary has not been structurally analysed, and it is unclear how the cells align relative to these channels.

Instances of patients with elevated cobalt ions in their blood have reported noteworthy cardiovascular problems, such as cardiomyopathy. Dark field in optical microscopy refers to an illumination method employed to heighten contrast in unstained specimens. The technique involves shining light onto the sample in such a way that the objective lens does not collect it, preventing it from contributing to the final image. As a result, this yields the characteristic effect of a dark, nearly black backdrop with illuminated objects standing out prominently. The amount of scattered light depends on the structure of the illuminated object and influences the brightness of the signal in the microscope image. This project will explore whether dark field illumination is sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in light scatter from cell specimens treated with cobalt from control specimens, using an existing dataset. If successful, dark field microscopy may provide a simple, label free means of assessing cobalt uptake in biological specimens.",

One of these is entropy, which is an uncertainty of information: in the context of biofilms, this manifests as the dissimilarity of cell position across biofilms.",

However, many different types of pattern and behaviours exist in nature, and these are not yet measured in mature colony biofilms. One of these properties is lacunarity. Lacunarity is a measure of how data fills space. It complements fractal dimension, which measures how much space is filled. This project will explore the role of lacunarity in biofilm formation, and will understand whether this correlates with fractal dimension.",

What disease models most consistently demonstrate the paradoxical roles of HMGB1? 2. How do experimental variables (e.g., animal model, disease stage, HMGB1 isoforms, redox states, receptor interactions) influence HMGB1’s role? 3. What are the therapeutic implications of targeting HMGB1 in diseases with conflicting evidence of benefit or harm?",
        outline: "High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) is a non-histone nuclear protein involved in chromatin architecture and gene transcription. When released extracellularly, HMGB1 acts as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) with diverse immunomodulatory roles. Paradoxically, HMGB1 can exhibit pro-inflammatory effects (e.g., through TLR4 and RAGE pathways) and anti-inflammatory or tissue-protective roles (e.g., depending on its redox state, binding partners, or cellular context). This dual nature complicates its potential as a therapeutic target in conditions such as sepsis, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neuroinflammation. A systematic review synthesizing how HMGB1 functions in different disease models will provide clarity on this paradox and identify gaps in translational applications. Objectives 1. To systematically review experimental and preclinical disease models investigating HMGB1’s dual inflammatory roles. 2. To identify the molecular and contextual factors contributing to HMGB1’s paradoxical activity. 3. To map knowledge gaps and propose directions for future translational research.",
